No. This is a story, the story of a man. A man named Tow Ubukata. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn light of the continuous offenses on seemingly all fronts of this man\u2019s involvement with the anime industry, many are legitimately wondering why staffers continue to hire him on as a writer. Not to be facetious or rhetorical, but seriously, why hire someone who\u2019s writing has simply never been well received critically? Because critical reception isn\u2019t what brings in the benjamins. Tow Ubukata is not just an anime guy. He\u2019s a multimedia creative who\u2019s made no shortage of money for no shortage of light novel publications, manga magazines, video game publishers, and even the producers of feature films. While his big debut and long-time claim to fame, Black Season, was only acclaimed as the amateur novel it was and only recognized thanks to Kadokawa\u2019s Young Novelist Sneaker Award which it won, he continued keeping himself relevant with work on cult classic video games like Shenmue and more serious, less pulpy works soon after like Tenchi Meisatsu, a historical period-piece about J\u014dky\u014d Era calendar making. However, his biggest claim to relevancy within the industry\u2014if not within the community itself\u2014was actually his column in Newtype Magazine, A Gambler\u2019s Life. A Gambler\u2019s Life was a long-running comedy strip which kept the audience up with his personal life while also being something of a stand-up comedy piece about his day-to-day and the wittiness he found therein. Now, this modest column was nothing on the level of the multimillion dollar vlogging channels you see all over YouTube nowadays, but it also wasn\u2019t obscure, and even if the actual community didn\u2019t find it endearing or entertaining, the industry players at large saw it as a confidence inspiring PR move. It\u2019s like how job interviewers this day in age are beginning to recommend applicants have a social media presence. The social status of prospective employees is obviously irrelevant to the job at hand, but proof of their sociability can place more confidence in their employers who now have the option to hire someone with a resume which extends beyond the monotonous and often overstated piece of paper which was once the only genuine article. And Japanese companies eat this kind of stuff up all the time. In fact, Production IG specifically has fallen victim to this ignorant misconception of the relevancy of public figures to such an extent, they willingly paid out of their own pocket to hire the dying artist, Marty Friedman, to preform the ending theme for B: The Beginning after considering the fact the project was made in association with Netflix, an American company with a Western audience. It\u2019s crazy, and Tow Ubukata is just one of the many who get to ride the coattails of their own preconceived social perceptions\u2014whether or not they still exist, or whether they died back in \u201996 after the world at large forgot about this nobody who got a big head once after winning an amateur award against a bunch of highschoolers this one time. It\u2019s the same reason we\u2019re being inundated with isekai all over again. It\u2019s not like people actually want more isekai. It\u2019s the fact Re:Zero proved the prospective earnings of the genre in 2016 after the original Sword Art Online isekai boom was thought to have long since died out, but the production cycles for all these Re:Zero-pushed adaptations took years to realize, so only now are we getting hit with the brunt of it, the brunt of a marketing ploy three years late for a genre cash-in inspired by the success of an anime which was only as successful as it was BECAUSE IT BROKE ALL THOSE TROPES. It\u2019s irony in its most tangible extreme, and it\u2019s why Tow Ubukata can write for the likes of Production IG despite being a widely known hack amongst actual fans, and despite the point I\u2019ve been holding onto for a minute now, beating his wife. I\u2019m legally obligated to tell you the judge dropped his domestic violence charges, but I\u2019m also morally obligated to tell you he did so only because his wife didn\u2019t want to press charges in fear of further jeopardizing their marriage, not because the poor woman actually redacted her initial claims to the police. After all, as Donald Trump proved with the 2016 American Presidential Election, there\u2019s no such thing as bad publicity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, unfortunately, there is such thing as bad writing. Tow Ubukata had once said in an interview he believed a portion of individual human psychology could only be exactly understood through the act of gambling, and the analogy he used regarded games like roulette. He feels the draw of such games is the fact the player has to decide how much to put down even before the game begins, and only after that do they have the privilege to think about a possibility at victory. To him, taking that initial responsibility for what you can afford is very bold and honorable. While I myself agree with his analysis of the game, I find it more reasonable to attribute that \u201cresponsibility\u201d to simple thrill. You\u2019re not putting your money on black so you can feel good about yourself when proudly forking over your cash when the ball lands on red. You\u2019re putting your money on black so you get the adrenaline rush of not knowing where the ball will land, and doubly for the serotonin spike within that victory should the odds be ever in your favor. But disagreements be as they may, this is actually kind of a phycological goldmine. If this is how romanticized of a viewpoint this man has on the world and human action, it no longer stands as a surprise he writes characters the way he does. A needlessly enigmatic shadow-villain with the scripting and design sensibilities of a fourteen year old would be hella cool if you held on to the belief their initial plans paying off somewhere down the line validated their character\u2014whether or not they were actually developed into human beings or characterized at all along the way, and despite all the time of your\u2019s they wasted spouting mysterious codifications you had no reason or wherewithal to care about or become invested in other than the blanket reassurance that they sounded cool. And it\u2019s that attempt at looking or sounding vaguely cool that Ubukata has defined himself with since the dawn of his career. Even the man\u2019s so-called name, Tow Ubukata, is a pointless pseudonym he instated because all cool authors have a pen name, right? Looking back at all his work scripting for video games, his character writing is some of the most blatantly self-insertable I\u2019ve ever seen. Chaos Legion is the creme of the chuunibyo indulgent crop, and while Shenmue is beloved by many people, Ryo just IS Ubukata before he let his hair grow out. The idea Ubukata\u2019s personal fanboyisms can be traced as deeply as his influence over things as detached from the actual script at hand as character designs might be endearing if he was, lets say, talented, but the fact his works are so bad leave developments as boldfaced as this looking little more than juvenile and embarrassing. If you want to know his thought process behind his first mass-market success, Mardock Scramble, look no further than said designs therein. He stated in consideration of the action sequences, should the work ever find itself being animated (which it did), he was aways at odds with the dilemma of bangs. He thought if a character's hair was long enough, their face would get covered by their bangs, and by hiding their face, a sense of mystique could be brought about by the viewer not knowing what emotions the character is feeling. On the other hand, he worried\u2014shockingly out loud, without shame or self-awareness\u2014if the villain's emotions were completely visible, they\u2019d lose their quote-unquote mystique, so he simply couldn\u2019t give them short hair. In light of such cringeworthy notes, his quote, \u201cif it\u2019s written in a way so each staff member can interpret the text their own way, work can't be done,\u201d stops sounding like the objectivist preachings of a craftsman and starts sounding more like the self-serious whines of a man-child clinging so tightly to his own predisposed concepts as to look like a baby getting potentially robbed of his precious pacifier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, this obsession with the stereotypical \u201ccool\u201d is not something I derived from that gambling story or the pre-teen shlock that is Mardock Scramble, but something I derived from his actual life. The anecdote regarding his interpretation of gambling was a good segue which just happened to give insight into the eyes of a man clearly interpreting reality in something of a different and interesting way than your average joe, but what came before his bold and honorable gambling and wife beating was his birth. Tow Ubukata is Japanese, but he was raised prior to his highschool years in Singapore, and later Nepal. All the while, though, despite attributing his authorship of an edgy story the likes of the aforementioned Mardock Scramble to the quote-unquote feelings of frustration and resignation felt by his generation, he very diligently and traditionally practiced honing his skills with speaking and writing in his native language, and he apparently did so far more than he studied Malay, Mandarin, or Nepali because he felt a great amount of pride keeping his Japanese heritage alive within himself. This personal study was where he sparked his passion for writing, but when he finally returned to his homeland as a young man, he was shocked and self-admittedly terrified by the concept of katsuji-banare. Katsuji-banare was what\u2014for lack of a better term\u2014Japanese boomers who resented the millennial generation for their disinterest in literature used to refer to the phenomenon of their collective doing so. To Ubukata, the ubiquitousness of this phrase was a bad omen warning all novelists\u2014especially amateur novelists such as himself\u2014they would soon find themselves and their work out of demand. In light of these discouraging developments (which never came true and were obviously just the insecurities of pretentious academic elites), he decided to put his writing career on hold and use his exposure from the Sneaker Award to instead get into the video game and anime industry, scenes which he thought more viable and future-proof. When put into this perspective, it makes no shortage of sense a man who pursued a certain artistic career solely on the back of job security paranoia would take to the trends like a kite to the wind, because what else would seeing the success of overly indulgent video game schlock do to a creator\u2014a creator so already ostentatiously sure of his own ability as to drop out of university the second he won an amateur award and received ANY recognition beyond himself he is, indeed, talented\u2014than reassure them that\u2019s exactly what the consumers are out to spend their money on, and moreover, that\u2019s exactly what they should spend the remainder of their career churning out. After all, even after getting serious with his first critically accepted work, Tenchi Meisatsu, Ubukata was still writing for the likes of Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTow Ubukata\u2019s self-proclaimed inspiration to even write fiction in the first place was an occasion on which he lied to his friend about his apparent understanding of Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind and its alleged Christian symbolism when he was completely unfamiliar with the religion itself on every level. I know this is earth-shatteringly ironic given his success with something as confusingly vapid in its attempt at religious symbolism as Le Chevalier D\u2019Eon years later, but this explains a lot, and now that I\u2019ve laid a historical foundation for you to profile this man of your own accord, so does everything else I\u2019ve typed here. Mamoru Oshii was able to write Angel\u2019s Egg not because he had a pang of wild inspiration, but because his parents were Christian zealots who inundated him with their religion until it was engraved in his very bones, only for him to grow up a realist, realize all religion is horse shit, and then spend years of his young adult life grappling with the crushing nihilistic realization the egg is, indeed, empty. Chiaki Konaka was able to write Serial Experiments Lain not because he thought computers were super dope and smoked a bunch of weed one time, but because he programmed games, websites, and forum bases before half the Earth knew what the internet even was, let alone tried to use it. Tow Ubukata\u2019s Le Chevalier D\u2019Eon was a nonsensical clusterfuck of retarded assholes yelling and screaming at each other, because he was too busy slave driving the Production IG staff into getting the fabric details on the character\u2019s clothing right to worry about the pile of still unfinished theming and scripting haunting the story\u2019s core. His Psycho-Pass 2 was a masturbatory concept fetish forcing a pseudo-intellectual writer\u2019s power play upon an audience too smart not to see its inconsistencies and illogicalities, because the production cycle was fucked sideways and instead of using his limited time to write a modest story sound enough to hold the series over on behalf of the main team who was making a movie, he pestered the main team to death\u2014now disrupting the movie\u2019s production cycle as well\u2014to ask the series\u2019 actual writer, Urobuchi Gen, what he was allowed and not allowed to do with all his cool concepts for the soul purpose of executing said masturbation with cyberpunk ideation he could never dream of coming up with on his own creative rights. His Ghost in the Shell: Arise was an otherwise innocuous\u2014if criminally boring and artless\u2014installment to a franchise which, throughout all its illustrious incarnations, has remained as the gold standard for all Japanese animation at some point in its distinguished legacy which was lampooned anyway for misunderstanding not only what previous and more competent creative staff had used in the past to cement it into the history books, but for disrespecting the very foundation they\u2019d setup only to deliver a version of his own making so unceremoniously mediocre as to be offensively heinous by any comparison. However, what makes such bastardizations truly deplorable are the terribly misguided reasons he was made able to take part in their creation in the first place. He was able to write for Le Chevalier D\u2019Eon because his work with Shenmue, a video game so seated in his own male power fantasies, its main protagonist was designed to look exactly like him, had worked in cooperation with his deceiving community presence to convince President Ishikawa and IG\u2019s producers he could write a historical adaptation, even if seated in incest fetishes, inaccurate historical timelines, and symbolism so non-sequitur as to be comedic. He was able to write for Psycho-Pass 2 because his work with Mardock Scramble, a cyberpunk who\u2019s crowning conceptual jewel was a talking rat who was actually the Architect from The Matrix Revolutions, had worked in cooperation with his deceiving community presence to convince President Ishikawa and IG\u2019s producers he could replace a writer ninety times his caliber on a project he didn\u2019t even have a part in building. He was able to write for Ghost in the Shell: Arise because his work with Fafner in the Blue Sky, an Eva Clone who\u2019s production and reception IG cared for so little, they outsourced every frame of it to their subsidiary studio Xebec, had worked in cooperation with his deceiving community presence to convince President Ishikawa and IG\u2019s producers he could somehow write something at all meaningful to contend with Evangelion\u2019s intellectually monumental legacy. And what\u2019s he doing now? Butchering Osamu Dazai\u2019s epoch defining literature into an urban fantasy anime action spectacle set to dubstep and further eviscerating Production IG\u2019s beloved and beautiful Psycho-Pass, devoting an industry crowning display of modern animation production prowess to a plot delving into the aftershocks felt by a country shifting from isolationism to immigration, despite the fact said country was established such that having it do so betrays the entire fucking intelligence of its institution and even after poor Makoto Fukami already proved with the Sinners of the System film trilogy he could very well handle the franchise without Urobuchi Gen around to make it a true masterpiece, or most certainly without this hack around to desecrate yet another god forsaken season of it either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you for reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCitation Notice: Everything I stated in this piece except for my adjectives was throughly verified fact and, in many cases, paraphrased direct quotations.

A damning &amp; downright offensive example of the worst this culture has to offer.<br>\r\n<b>Two:<\/b> A Two is of such poor quality, it is impossible to take seriously or feel immersed in at all. A Two is objectively bad in a major way, &amp; it is so shamelessly shoddy &amp; soulless, I cannot respect it on any level.<br>\r\n<b>Three:<\/b> A Three, much like a Two, is of such poor quality, it is impossible to take seriously or feel immersed in at all. However, while they are also objectively bad in a major way, a Three was actually made with some genuine thought or effort. It undoubtedly failed, but it actually tried on some level. If nothing else, I can at least respect it for that.<br>\r\n<b>Four:<\/b> A Four is subjectively bad, &amp; therefore impossible for me to enjoy. A Four is a work for which I am not the target audience, &amp; that\u2019s totally fine. Nevertheless, I cannot give these works a positive score in good faith when I simply didn\u2019t like them. A Four may also be objectively bad to a certain degree, but if so, only in minor ways. <br>\r\n<b>Five:<\/b> A Five is objectively bad in a major way &amp; deserves to be a Three. However, a Five is also subjectively good in an equally major way &amp; therefore deserves a non-negative score. I enjoy them personally, but I\u2019m not so blind nor so biased as to pretend they are actually high-quality. Fives can usually be characterized in one of two ways: a work which had clear ambition, heart, &amp; soul, but little technique or expertise to actually craft something decent, or a work which was simply trashy &amp; self-indulgent in ways I personally enjoyed. I know most people consider Five to be the \u201caverage\u201d score, but I choose to interpret it as the literal intersection between the \u201cgood\u201d &amp; the \u201cbad.\u201d<br>\r\n<b>Six:<\/b> A Six is comprehensively competent enough for me to treat with respect &amp; view seriously. While a Six may have certain objectively bad elements of little significance, these elements are either minor enough to not consistently interrupt my immersion or so completely overshadowed by what makes the work both objectively &amp; subjectively good as to be relatively trivial. A Six is great, &amp; while it isn\u2019t masterful enough to be totally immersive, a Six is my baseline of enjoyment &amp; quality, the point at which I\u2019m finally able to engage with the entertainment in front of me.<br>\r\n<b>Seven:<\/b> Anime &amp; manga I consider Honorable Mentions to My Favorites List. A Seven is an extremely high-quality anime or manga which I was sincerely invested in, or which I simply must recognize as masterful. Due to minor subjective flaws, or perhaps even <i>extremely<\/i> minor objective flaws, they could not achieve the absolute immersion required by My Favorites List. A Seven is a work which can elicit enough genuine &amp; instinctive emotional investment out of me, you\u2019d think it would reach My Favorites List, but during which I can nevertheless catch my attention fading, if only for my flaws as a consumer as opposed to its flaws as a creative work. <br>\r\n<b>Eight, Nine, &amp; Ten:<\/b> Anime &amp; manga on My Favorites List. Without any objective or subjective flaws worthy of speech, I feel an uninterrupted immersion which allows me to truly care about the work in question, &amp; this feeling is what defines My Favorites List. These are works of art I have in mind so often, they genuinely &amp; meaningfully influence my real life. I can connect with &amp; care for their characters as if they were people; I can internalize their themes as if they were life lessons; I can fully realize &amp; appreciate their concepts &amp; fantasies; &amp; I can treat the stories they tell with the seriousness &amp; gravitas I could afford to nonfiction. My Favorites List is spread across three rating levels so I can freely delineate between the very subtle &amp; diverse ways in which these works resonate with me.<br>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/anime.plus\/SingleH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"userimg\" src=\"https:\/\/image.myanimelist.net\/ui\/Tcz3bOwN1bsWo-ulYhBD4P2UGy-poaDE4LzyYjAUMEOQsNkhtGzJ56MlQvfd1-PuPigh5rcnO7x5E2O8RNOZ0lvokWMVFXPp4Ur7csEnuFyNDKAC63to9rOmq2YHgyjh6wsDZPG-0DgubcbYj6Ko-MP-lVVxlF0TkqfedChxxK6fq4KQG1YmbF5UnwO4c9IxE1gMx6UoonAZpz1xecFVMQ\"><\/a><\/div><br>\r\n- <span style=\"color: red\"><b>My reviews do not follow this rating system.<\/b><\/span> Applying such a personalized rating system to public reviews would be ridiculous.<br>\r\n- A score given to an anime I'm currently <b>Watching<\/b> is just a prediction, but a score given to a manga I'm currently <b>Reading<\/b> is a solid rating.<br>\r\n- To guarantee the integrity of my scores and My Rating System, I cannot score anything I've <b>Dropped<\/b> higher than a Four.<br>\r\n- An anime entry <b>On-Hold<\/b> is a non-scored show I\u2019ve finished which I\u2019m considering for My Favorites List, but a manga entry <b>On-Hold<\/b> is actually on-hold: something I\u2019m not exactly keeping up with, but something which I still haven\u2019t actually dropped.<br>\r\n- I try my best to write something in the tags for every entry on my Anime List &amp; Manga List, but for obvious reasons, there\u2019s often not much to say about Twos and Threes.
