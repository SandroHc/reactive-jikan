      "content": "Integrating into society is undoubtedly tough when one has been bred solely for a single purpose for as long as they can remember. \u2018Suisei no Gargantia\u2019 and \u2018Violet Evergarden\u2019 showcase a vision and an opportunity to open one\u2019s eyes to look beyond the bloodshed and sacrifices of war into a world where there is something worth living for. \u2018Suisei no Gargantia\u2019 depicts a person\u2019s sheltered life and the pilgrimage he has to go through when being thrown into a world of great bewilderment. Aside from the impressive animation, the show is able to draw out its tenacity whenever it portrays a view that requires a considerable level of emotion. A series that is deemed high stature with unequivocal originality is hard to come by, thus deserving recognition when it surfaces. \u2018Violet Evergarden\u2019 is the mother of all things magical and what \u2018Suisei no Gargantia\u2019 could have been had it expanded on its narrative. The story is of rich substance and audiences will find themselves laughing throughout this memorable journey\u2026and crying during the most emotional of times. The quality of the animation and character expression are second-to-none, something worth acknowledging which is a commendation to the series.",
