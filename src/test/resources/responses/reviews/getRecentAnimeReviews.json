      "review": "Short Review (Spoiler-free): In summary, Re:Zero Season 2 Part 2 is amazing. It won't change your perception of the isekai genre, and if you are not a fan of fantasy main characters having expanding harems, this season won't make you a fan of those problematic elements. And by that, I do mean there are issues with the show. However, it boils down to this: if you ever cried your eyes out as a kid reading classic fairytales and picture books, this season is going to evoke some of those feelings in a sincere and powerful way few shows can match. With more grounded character growth,more stable and confident pace and worldbuilding, Re:Zero Season 2 Part 2 is a testament to its writers' talent and dedication. \n\nBaseline quality: 9.7\/10. Reduced to 9.2\/10 due to some issues. \n\nRecommended to: those who look for deep worldbuilding and characterization in anime, fans of adventure stories with a classic feel to them. Fans of isekai (duh~). \n\nPros: (minor character spoilers)\n\n+ Amazing characterization for most of the characters. Emilia finally got the arc for her character to shine after 30+ episodes of doubt (her own doubts about herself plus the audience's doubts for why this na\u00efve, idealistic damsel-in-distress who barely did anything has been the leading female character for 1.5 seasons). If the author Tappei Nagatsuki planned her huge moments in this season since the very beginning, then kudos to him. Great character arcs dominate and define this season. Even Echidna, the enigmatic and low-key sinister witch of Greed, goes through a touching and believable arc with her limited screen time. With Subaru's current development, the show has mostly overcome the lowly power-fantasy roots revolving the deathloop\/save-load ability (it took 50 episodes of mostly consistent and sustained development, but it's worthy). A lot of foreshadowing and blink-and-you-will-miss-it clues reached their fulfillment here. \n\n+ Worldbuilding. Like the past two seasons, this continues to be the main reason for Re:Zero to rise above most isekai for me. Its world continues to be a lively and lived-in world where each character has their rich mythology, backstory and agenda. For example, Emilia's childhood in the Elf's forest gives us an epitome of what happened hundreds of years ago to this world at large. There are far more interesting locations and characters for this season to cover in detail, but at least the show lets you know they are not just props or plot devices. The worldbuilding is still not on the Lord of the Rings level, but top-notch in any anime genre, nonetheless. \n\n+ Satisfying and hopeful. Shedding the overtly gloomy tone of S2 Part 1, the latest 12 episodes we got bring the main characters and the audience to a real and wholesome win, and deservedly so. \n\n+ Many memorable and sincerely tearful moments. For someone as jaded as me, I know a show is something when a few episodes could bring me to tears several times. The show relies on certain sensationalist crutches for sure, but there is clear sincerity in most of those pivotal moments. \n\n+ Overall amazing audio-visual presentation. Photography, character facial animations and lighting especially stand out. \n\nCons: (moderate character spoilers)\n\n- The main character's ridiculously expanding harem, just like the previous seasons. In addition to Emilia, Rem and Petra, now Beatrice joins the battle for Subaru's No.1. Arguably though, Beatrice is a \"Great Spirit\" who implicitly went into contract\/friendship with Subaru at the end of the season, landing their relationship more on the platonic side. But Subaru's emotional confession to her rubbed me the wrong way, for it is far more convincing and touching than his confession to Emilia earlier. (I can't even imagine what fan arts that ship Subaru and Beatrice will do). \n\n- Ram's undying love and attempt to redeem Roswaal feels wonky, and closer to a bad case of Stockholm's syndrome than a believable and angelic choice. Perhaps the original light novel gives more details to how she had transformed after interacting with the main characters, but in the anime all Roswaal did was grooming her and putting her into total servitude (plus many suspected that sexual abuse was involved as well). Should the anime made it clearer that Ram never truly lost her agency (and was only pretending to be totally obedient to Roswaal), or that she has gained the genuine concept of \"friend\" in her own arc and now wants to see Roswaal as a friend, I would have much less issue with this sequence. \n\n- A few unnecessary cutesy moments. The show is at its best when delivering mature and steady storytelling, so I wish the showrunners can be more confident with what they do the best and limit unnecessary fan service. With the franchise's popularity still rising, we are only bound for more fan service, but this is only a minor complaint. \n\nIn the end, Re:Zero Season 2 Part 2 is a testament to what the writers and showrunners can do (especially Tappei Nagatsuki, with Vivy also under his belt, he's been killing at it in recent years). I dodged it in 2021 because of my tendency to shun the isekai genre, but I am more than willing to rewatch this season, maybe even the entire series so far, in order to put more hidden clues together. If you have struggled through (sometimes seemingly) problematic parts of the past seasons, and allowed these characters to grow on you (and they themselves grow quite a lot), this season will bring joyful tears to you.",
