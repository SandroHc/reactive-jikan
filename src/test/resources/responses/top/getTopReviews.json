Sword Art Online is more or less the equivalent of a fanfiction in it's writing and quality. Whether people want to overlook it or not is up to the individual, but I believe it fails at the fundamentals for writing a good story. This review will go into details as to my opinions on why I feel this way. 1) Story - This is first major problem is the show. Let's start from thebeginning shall we. The first arc consists of 14 episodes. The first 2 episodes are honestly pretty good and set up the plot of the show that should follow. You're introduced to the main characters and it shows mmo style of play. I mean with 2 episodes that are amazing, surely what follows will be more of the adventures of the main characters and these mmo boss fights...right? Wrong. What follows are 5 completely irrelevant side character episodes and unnecessary terrible time skips that ruin any sense of a story the first 2 episodes set up. So due to some illogical reason, we're now down to 7 episodes to tell the rest of this story. Still doable right? RIGHT? Wrong again. The series wastes another 2 1\/2 episodes on pointless filler garbage. So there you have it over half of first part of the story has nothing to do with the overall plot. Well what about the other episodes you ask? The remaining \"plot\" episodes are filled with deus ex machina in its purest form. Even the finale of the first season makes absolutely no sense. This isn't a fantasy world, it's a freaking video game, you can't have miracles here. So that concludes my issues with season 1, which the majority of SAO fans consider to be the best part....Yeh you heard me, the 2nd part is even worse.\n       Without going into spoilers, the 2nd part of the series takes place in a different setting, with a mostly new cast aside from our main hero. This part of the series probably deserves the award for most unnecessary story in the history of anime. This arc is pretty much a mario game. Our hero must save the princess in the castle. Not really much to say about it. Oh yeh deus ex machina finale here too...oh and there's an incest subplot...for some reason. This concludes the plot section. I think I'm being pretty generous with a 4 here. \n\n2) Art - The art is fantastic. Colorful characters, bosses (the few we see), and settings are all here. It's easily worth an 8.\n\n3) Sound - Again fantastic. Nothing wrong with it at all. 8.\n\n4)Characters - Here we go...This is easily the worst part of the series. I'll separate the main characters and lump together the not so main characters.\n\nKirito\/Kazuto - The main character of this show is the epitome of the current definition of a \"Gary Stu\". He has no personality whatsoever. He is good at everything he tries for no reason. He's an amazing player, an super sleuth, a ladies man, and a master hacker. You name it, he can do it. There's no reason given for this other than he's just that good. Girls all love him, guys want to be him, and villains are jealous of him. He also solos MMO boss fights...yeh wrap your head around that one. Side note - I often see people claim they love this show because they're hardcore gamers. I have to say as an avid gamer myself I find this show to be insulting. Unless you've hacked or cheated , I don't understand why you're content with a character who does. Side note over. \n\nAsuna - The main female lead\/most blatant waifu  character ever. Asuna is introduced as a strong player who can stand on her own with Kirito, that is for the first couple episodes. Once she reappears she barely does anything other than cook for Kirito. That's right, her ass stays in the kitchen, while Kirito does all the important stuff. In part 2 she does absolutely nothing...seriously. She again has no original personality...textbook Tsundere. \n\nYui - This character is terrible in all senses of the word. She's walking deus ex machina, nothing more. This character should be hated by any gamer, since she's a cheat device, who adds nothing to the story. \n\nVillains (minor spoilers) - There are 2 major villains in this series and they're both terrible. The first one forgets his motives for doing everything in part 1 and the part 2 one is so comically evil he can't even be taken seriously. \n\nOther Characters\/ Who the hell cares - The female characters all want to have sex with Kirito and have no personality past this. The male characters don't get to do anything because Kirito hogs the show from everyone. That's really all there is to say about that.\n\nSuguha - This is Kirito's sister. She honestly has layers and was a plus to the show in my opinion. I don't know why she's in this show, she doesn't belong in it...\n\nSo yeh, Gary Stu and Waifu - these characters are pathetic (1).\n\n5) Enjoyment - Needless to say I didn't enjoy it. Poor show (3)\n\n6) Overall - This show has so many fans, and I really don't know why. Its plot is rushed and terrible. Its characters so flat, it's almost funny...almost. Its romance is highly misogynistic and terribly developed. I felt insulted watching this, and don't understand how any could like this show. Even Gamers.","episodes_watched":25,"scores":{"overall":4,"story":4,"animation":8,"sound":8,"character":1,"enjoyment":3},"entry":{"mal_id":11757,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/11757\/Sword_Art_Online","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/39717.jpg?s=e418310b575f6afe9ac03b383527169d","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/39717t.jpg?s=e418310b575f6afe9ac03b383527169d","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/39717l.jpg?s=e418310b575f6afe9ac03b383527169d"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/39717.webp?s=e418310b575f6afe9ac03b383527169d","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/39717t.webp?s=e418310b575f6afe9ac03b383527169d","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/39717l.webp?s=e418310b575f6afe9ac03b383527169d"}},"title":"Sword Art Online"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/LordAura","username":"LordAura","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/3441293.jpg?t=1644724200"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/3441293.webp?t=1644724200"}}}},{"mal_id":14837,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=14837","type":"anime","votes":5017,"date":"2009-05-06T19:20:00+00:00","review":"I laughed... I cried... I experienced something that changed my life... In a nutshell, Clannad ~After Story~ influenced the way I will live for the rest of my life and not just in some half-assed way like any other show would. It legitimately moved me to make certain decisions, for better or for worse. In that sense, no other anime can compare, as no other anime has provided an equivalent reaction on my part. Before you continue, you should know that Clannad ~After Story~ is a continuation of the story from Clannad and an adaptation from the original Visual Novel by KEY. Although knowledge of the first seasonis not necessary, it is highly recommended if you want to get the most out of ~After Story~ as well as this review. That being said, this review is tailored to all readers, and can be understood without knowledge of the first season. Note that there may be very minor spoilers. Now then, on to the meat and potatoes.\n\nI won't spend much time on the individual components of Clannad ~After Story~ (or Clannad ~AS~ as I will call it now) like I have with my other reviews. At first glance, there is nothing notably outstanding about it as a whole. For those who are interested in the individual components, here they are and the reasons behind them are available at the end of the review:\n\nStory: 8.7\/10\nArt\/Animation: 8.4\/10\nSound: 7.8\/10\nCharacter: 9.7\/10\nEnjoyment (in this case influence): 10+\/10 \nOverall: 9.8\/10\n\n\n| Main Review |\nIt is difficult to convey the emotions that went through my mind as I watched Clannad ~AS~. For those of you who watched the first season and dropped the show, I urge you to pick up ~AS~ and give it a chance. The first few episodes run almost identically to those of the first season, but the true After Story part branches off in a manner that is unique only to ~AS~. What Clannad ~AS~ gives the viewer is a story of life. A story of despair. A story of forgiveness. A story of hope. Through this story, Clannad ~AS~ can powerfully change the way you perceive the world around you. I am well aware that not everyone enjoys Clannad and ~AS~, especially since the magical light orbs are outlandish to some, but for me it was a bit of a godsend among anime.\n\nThe concept of Clannad ~AS~ is neither truly unique nor breathtakingly wonderful. What the viewer gets when watching it is the story of a man. Nothing less and nothing more. What Clannad ~AS~ really excels at, however, is the way it tells the story of that man. While it may be classified as a romance or even a harem anime by some (at least the first season could be), I really classify Clannad ~AS~ as a slice of life. A slice out of the life of a delinquent who can\u2019t seem to do anything right and struggles to protect what really matters to him as the world comes crashing down.\n\nHowever, \u201cslice of life\u201d can be a deceptive term. As I watched Clannad ~AS~, it was not as much a slice out of Tomoya\u2019s life but a slice out of mine. You see, what Kyoani succeeds in is hitting on the points that make life truly what it is. The continuation of time. The reality of truth. The genuine meaning of \u201clife goes on.\u201d Additionally, by extending over many years, the true significance of every event begins to emerge. Clannad ~AS~ takes the tale of the first season and shapes it around a single person. It is a respectable reflection of life and delves into what many shows do not, and cannot, represent: the story after the story. \n\nWhile many of the situations may be overblown and excessively dramatized (at least in the opinion of some people), it is ultimately true that every facet of Clannad ~AS~ gives the audience some insight into life. Does it matter that there are miracles and magic orbs of light flying around? For me, no. For others, this could be the case. That is to say, not all aspects of Clannad ~AS~ are perfect, but the impact was enough for me. \n\nIf you are looking for a cheerful anime, turn away now. Kyoto Animation does many things with Clannad ~AS~ including some very effective humor in many places, but Clannad ~AS~ will make you cry and smile, often both in the same episode. I won\u2019t lie, I cried at least 5 times throughout the season. Even when rewatching episodes, I cried again. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Clannad ~AS~ really has some happy moments as well, but Kyoani tends to depress many, many times. Each sad moment is profound and beautiful, but nevertheless it is sad. The ending song, Torch, which is played in every episode, serves to alleviate this, for better or worse. Torch is very upbeat, but many people consider it unnecessary and I agree. Torch can be a real mood breaker at times.\n\nThe power that Clannad ~AS~ exerts comes from its characters. While the first season portrayed many main characters and their stories, ~AS~ focuses on the life of Tomoya and lightly on the lives of those who surround him. Tomoya is a failure in a cruel world. In a sense, he is a fatal hero. While he may not know it, he is destined to face pain and suffering through his life. There is a bit of controversy over the ending of ~AS~, but those who wish to have a \u201ctruer\u201d ending can consider the second to last episode as such (don\u2019t hate me for suggesting it). When seen in that light, Clannad ~AS~ effectively played out a story that neither catered to an audience nor skewed reality (except for the orbs of light, of course). What it presented was something that many people can relate to. The loss of a loved one. The pain of recovery. The neglect of a father. Rediscovering love and friendship. Coping with suffering. *SPOILER* The feeling of holding a daughter in your arms for the first time. The pains and joys of being a father. *\/SPOLER* What it ended with was a realistic ending and a message for the future. Additionally, if seen that way, the last episode can be portrayed as Kyoani staying true to the visual novel and respecting the source material.\n\n*Unfortunately, more talk of the plot would undeniably lead to spoilers, which I am trying to keep free from this review, so please bear with me. Heck, if I\u2019ve convinced you at this point, what are you waiting for? Go see for yourself what all the hype is about. Otherwise, read on!*\n\nUltimately, Clannad ~AS~ molded characters that I thought I was familiar with into something close to human. Their stories produced emotion that made me reconsider the situations of the people that I see every day. Through social commentary and moral struggles, the viewer can genuinely begin to respect Tomoya. I know I wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand half of what he did, but I truly began to respect the fact that he kept going, despite him being a fictional character. Through his struggles, I began to learn about myself. Through the struggles of those around him, I began to respect those whom I had once hated. This may seem extreme, and you may think that I am crazy, but what I write is nothing but the truth. Every episode gripped me, and many episodes evoked tearful reactions, which I am not very prone to. As I continued to watch, I could hardly bear waiting a week for each new episode to come out. At the same time, however, I knew that each episode held a bomb - a flood of emotions that could affect the rest of my day. Clannad ~AS~ went way beyond enjoyment \u2013 it went into the realm of what I could call an \u201cepiphany.\u201d\n\nCan the story of one man influence the lives of others? Is it still possible if that man is a fictional character? For me, I did not think it was possible for anime to extend its influence at such a level. Clannad ~AS~ proved me wrong time and time again. Look past the first season and the first few episodes, and perhaps you can begin to understand what I mean. \n\nFor those interested or who can relate after watching the show, this is the ultimate and most powerful result of the show as it applies to me. The following is the reason why I can\u2019t keep my mind off of Clannad ~AS~ and the reason why it will remain as my #1 favorite for what I know will be many, many seasons: *SPOILER* Through Clannad ~AS~, I have basically committed to wanting to have a baby. Ushio love. *\/SPOILER*\n\n\n| Analysis of components |\nStory:\nClannad ~AS~ is unique in its storytelling, but the story itself is nothing special. The earlier episodes present almost unrelated stories just as the first season did, but Clannad ~AS~ takes a turn for the better with a focus on a single character and his ordeal. At this point, Clannad ~AS~ does nothing but follow the life of a young adult, Tomoya. Sure there is drama (oh, is there drama) and there is romance, in a sense, but in reality, there is no real plot to speak of. What there is, however, is the tale of a life experience that can change the way you live. A real deterrent might come from some of the magic that inexplicably finds its way into Clannad (both seasons), but that never really bothered me. The ending is also less-than-stellar and can be a bit confusing, but as stated before, there\u2019s always the second to last episode to fall back on.\n\nArt\/Animation:\nThere is nothing blatantly wrong with the animation quality. Kyoto Animation produced Clannad ~AS~, so fans will know that there is nothing to fear. The character design is the same as that of Clannad and other KEY adaptations. The KEY character design is quite distinguishable, with its giant eyes. Personally, I am a fan, but other viewers might dislike the artwork. Other than that, Kyoani did another solid job with the animation, and there are no jerky movements that detract from the gorgeous lessons that unfold.\n\nSound:\nKyoani had its ups and downs with the music for Clannad ~AS~. In many aspects, Clannad ~AS~ shoots beyond other KEY adaptations with its unique, unconventional plotline and incredibly well enacted scenes of what could very well be the life of an individual. In fact, many of the ordeals that Tomoya must face strike a particularly strong emotional chord among many people. Who knows, you might not be that certain type of person, but I definitely was. Anyways\u2026 back to the music. Clannad ~AS~\u2019s opening sequence is a strong piano melody with deceptively deep lyrics. However, the ending sequence detracts from many of the spectacular moments, especially because Kyoani tends to end episodes on a sad note. As such, many would classify Torch (the ED) as an elaborate troll because it is too lively. Beyond the OP and ED, Clannad ~AS~ features tracks from the Visual Novel, which include very familiar tracks from the first season. Notable among these are the songs with lyrics, ie Ana. Certain parts of the OST mesh very well, and a powerful soundtrack can produce a powerful reaction. However, I don\u2019t remember anything in particular clearly standing out to me, and as previously mentioned, Torch ruined quite a few strong moments.\n\nCharacter:\nWhile most of the other aspects of Clannad ~AS~ are very similar to their counterparts in the first season, character development in ~AS~ take a turn for the better. Kyoani successfully made me hate characters that I loved and love characters that I hated. Through a roller coaster complete with dips and turns, Clannad ~AS~ changed the way I perceive all type of people. From Tomoya\u2019s seemingly disinterested, alcoholic father to Nagisa, a character who I actually deemed annoying in the first season, I came to understand what truly makes up a person. Every character really has a story behind their dejected or cheerful fa\u00e7ade. Despite the usual \u201cClannad magic,\u201d every character also turned out to be associable, adding to the personal level of the show. Even the more comical, secondary characters had their share of emotional moments, giving them real depth and giving the viewer a relatively accurate understanding of human nature. About half-way through the show, there is a certain character that changes many, many things. I won\u2019t spoil it now, but her unique appearance is what truly brought Clannad ~AS~ to unmatchable levels.\n\nEnjoyment\/Overall:\nEnjoyment is really up to the beholder. My view of enjoyment may be somewhat different from others\u2019. Clannad is not for everybody, but for those who dropped the first season, ~AS~ is truly on a league of its own and worth another shot. Every person has that one anime that leaps up above the rest and leaves a lasting impression. For me, that anime was Clannad ~AS~. No other words can describe the effect it had on me, and I hope that this review has at least made you, the reader, consider picking up this diamond in the rough.\n\n\n| Final Thoughts |\nThank you for your time (I know the review was long), and I sincerely wish that you give Clannad ~AS~ a chance. Who knows, it may change your life. As always, comments about how effectively this review worked are welcome. Also, a helpful rating is always appreciated.","episodes_watched":24,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":9,"animation":8,"sound":8,"character":10,"enjoyment":10},"entry":{"mal_id":4181,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/4181\/Clannad__After_Story","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1299\/110774.jpg?s=fd7907f8f2873fccbcea878e05bfe315","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1299\/110774t.jpg?s=fd7907f8f2873fccbcea878e05bfe315","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1299\/110774l.jpg?s=fd7907f8f2873fccbcea878e05bfe315"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1299\/110774.webp?s=fd7907f8f2873fccbcea878e05bfe315","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1299\/110774t.webp?s=fd7907f8f2873fccbcea878e05bfe315","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1299\/110774l.webp?s=fd7907f8f2873fccbcea878e05bfe315"}},"title":"Clannad: After Story"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/LemonLyme","username":"LemonLyme","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/104129.jpg?t=1381984200"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/104129.webp?t=1381984200"}}}},{"mal_id":2772,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=2772","type":"anime","votes":4980,"date":"2008-02-28T04:25:00+00:00","review":"There are two responses I get, without fail, every time I try to get someone new to watch this show. \"I don't like the art style\" or \"I've seen the dub - NO THANKS.\" I'm guilty of both of these myself. But if there's one thing I need to stress before even getting started on this review, it's that the 4Kids dub is NOT One Piece. For the love of god, PLEASE do not think it is. If you've suffered the misfortune of seeing some of the 4Kids episodes, just erase them from your mind and start fresh. Theybutchered it, there's really no other way to put it.  They cut episodes, changed the dialogue to fit a MUCH younger and apparently far less intelligent audience (almost insultingly so), gave the characters RIDICULOUS voices, and pretty much watered down the entire series.  FUNimation has done a much better job so far from what I've seen, but regardless, watching it in its original Japanese form with subtitles is really the way to go.\n\nAs for the art style, it's true, it's completely different from almost anything else I've seen.  Much more \"cartoonish\" and maybe not what you'd expect from an anime.  Despite that, you end up loving it.  I wouldn't even say that you have to \"get used to it\" because it's not something that detracts from the rest of the series in any way.  It didn't even take me two episodes before I was thoroughly enjoying it and seeing it as a fresh, new style, exciting almost and unlike anything I'd experienced before.  Now, some 300+ episodes later, I can't remember ever NOT liking it, or even why I would have.  Especially now with One Piece being aired in high definition, the art is crisp, clean, colorful - VERY sharp and wonderful to look at.\n\nNow that we've got those two points out of the way...\n\nOne Piece is actually one of the best shows I've ever seen, anime or otherwise.  The plot is pretty basic at first.  Monkey D. Luffy has just set out on his own to find the legendary treasure 'one piece' and become Pirate King, and he's looking for a crew to sail with him.  You'll find yourself falling in love with each and every new member as Luffy finds them.  They're all extremely well developed, with interesting backgrounds and unique, fun personalities.  They form one very quirky crew that's always discovering new adventures and somehow getting themselves into trouble as they strive to achieve their dreams.  Each main story arc introduces new minor characters as well, and they're just as much fun and easy to fall in love with as the Straw Hat crew.  Not one character is left out or feels like they're there for no reason.  Everyone has a purpose and adds to the storyline, and one of the really cool things about One Piece is that these 'purposes' often resurface at later points in the series.  No detail is left untouched, and you'll seriously be amazed by the way Oda threads together plots and characters and blends all their stories perfectly the more the series progresses.\n\nThe plot itself, though fairly straightforward at first like I said, quickly evolves into something HUGE.  Much of the beginning of the series is dedicated to forming the crew and letting you get to know the characters, though it's definitely never lacking in action, but once they reach the Grand Line, you're swept up in adventure after adventure and following some of the most fantastic story arcs you'll ever watch.  The battles and fights are well-paced, with the final boss fight almost always being completely EPIC.  But even through the action, One Piece never quite loses it's lighthearted, humorous edge.  The episodes are sprinkled with PLENTY of funny moments, never too many and never too few.  There's always a wonderful balance of action and humor.\n\nOne Piece also has its fair share of heart-wrenching moments, which may take you by surprise!   There are some EXTREMELY powerful scenes and episodes that kind of blindside you and leave you wondering when you became quite so emotionally attached to certain characters or other things.  I've definitely found myself near tears or actually crying at more than one point.  One Piece has it all - amazing characters, the never-ending yet never TOO over-the-top humor, exciting battles, fun adventures, heartbreaking moments with quick to follow touching moments.  And underneath everything, there's always the theme of friendship and teamwork, of working to reach your dreams and helping those closest to you achieve theirs, of growing and maturing as a person and discovering the power within yourself to overcome obstacles of any sort, of just BEING THERE for the rest of your crew when they need you - of being NAKAMA.\n\nIn a word, One Piece is perfect.  And perhaps I'm just biased, being an obviously OBSESSED fan at this point, haha, but what can I say?  It's been running for 344 episodes so far and not ONCE have I wondered or hoped that it would start to reach an end.  It is, simply put, amazing.\n\nSo why should you watch One Piece?\n\nBecause you're missing out on one hell of a fantastic show if you don't at least give it a try.","episodes_watched":344,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":10,"animation":9,"sound":9,"character":10,"enjoyment":10},"entry":{"mal_id":21,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/21\/One_Piece","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/73245.jpg?s=f3fe2e381fd21074b2bcee020c0fc4bf","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/73245t.jpg?s=f3fe2e381fd21074b2bcee020c0fc4bf","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/73245l.jpg?s=f3fe2e381fd21074b2bcee020c0fc4bf"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/73245.webp?s=f3fe2e381fd21074b2bcee020c0fc4bf","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/73245t.webp?s=f3fe2e381fd21074b2bcee020c0fc4bf","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/73245l.webp?s=f3fe2e381fd21074b2bcee020c0fc4bf"}},"title":"One Piece"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Maxine","username":"Maxine","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/23501.jpg?t=1642972800"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/23501.webp?t=1642972800"}}}},{"mal_id":229437,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=229437","type":"anime","votes":4082,"date":"2016-09-19T02:13:00+00:00","review":"Re:Zero truly wanted to be something. It shoots for the stars, it tries new things and throws the characters through so much torture and misery that the fantasy-world they are living in resembles more a hell. They boil in this hell, fuming with anger and regret, any shred of happiness they find fading almost immediately to nothing. But Re:Zero isn't something. It reaches for its dear, dear life, but remains in the end wholly unremarkable shounen fare interested more in shocking the viewer with gore and theatrics than in telling a genuinely meaningful story. Re:Zero may not be terrible and irredeemable, but it certainly strugglesthroughout most of its twenty-five episodes to demonstrate that there is more to it than this. What is there in Subaru's tragic story that the audience can take with them at the end? What does it want to say? Not a whole lot, to be sure. Re:Zero is ambitious in mediocrity, notable only for its perverted sense of drama. \n\n(Minor spoilers will follow from here, as it is near-impossible to discuss an anime like this without revealing anything.)\n\nI have seen many people compare Re:Zero to Steins;Gate in the months since its airing. This is a great disservice to Steins;Gate. Where Steins;Gate spent nearly half its runtime developing the setting and its characters before asking the audience to empathise with and feel for them, Re:Zero does so immediately and does not ever ask for consent. It never develops its setting in any meaningful way-- about all you know for the duration of the story is that it is generic fantasy-land where people hate witches and bad things happen all the time-- and it throws death and gore at the viewer from the very first episode, when nobody even knows or cares about who Subaru is. It is shocking to see major characters die within the first episode, to be fair, but it no longer feels shocking the second, third or eleventh time. \n\nIf there was any consequence to these events, it is immediately brought to nothing by the show's contrived gimmick of rebirth and time-travel. It doesn't really matter if someone does die, as time will conveniently bend backwards for Subaru's sake-- never to the beginning, and always to the last major event in the story. There is no cost and no meaning to anything that happens. Subaru's mistakes are immediately erased upon rebirth, and he can go on about his day with nothing but his own guilt holding him back. He is the God of his story and the world is his playground. \n\nWhat Re:Zero does to compensate for this is killing its characters off in increasingly brutal ways. They will lose their limbs, be hacked to death by chains or tortured to the point where they no longer resemble a human being. It is violence without meaning, as artificial as can be, extreme and over-the-top to the point that it can almost at times resemble satire. Everything that could possibly go wrong does go wrong for Subaru and friends, long before you are given any reason to care about their fates\u3000in the first place. The fifteenth episode is easily the biggest offender in this regard as it is nothing more than one massive slaughterfest, intent on making you feel bad for Subaru and his many waifus, him screaming in rage and gurgling on blood like it is some sort of torture porn. It is entirely possible for fiction to contain elements of death and gore without it negatively affecting the story, and in some cases it is even necessary, as it is for stories focused on issues such as war. Death is an entirely natural phenomenon, and humans are evidently not above committing acts such as murder. The issue with Re:Zero is that its death and gore exists for itself. It exists to shock and enrage the viewer, rather than serving as a product of the setting or as a vehicle for more substantial themes. For some people, this works, and throwing a character through a hurricane of awfulness is enough to instil sympathy. That's great, and I don't hold any ill will against these people. If anything, I am envious of how easily they can feel emotion. What actually bothers me is how effortless this method of storytelling truly is, and the audacity Re:Zero has to pretend it is something profound and on-par with film, as it did in the credits of the fifteenth episode. Re:Zero is visceral and sensually striking, and yet ever so empty. \n\n\"Empty\" can easily be used to describe the characters as well. Emilia, for example, exists as little more than a personification of the average anime fan's ideal woman, similar in many ways to Asuna from Sword Art Online, and lacking in any meaningful characterisation besides her occasionally getting upset at Subaru. It's even more baffling that Subaru chooses her in the world of romance when she has done very little to win over his affection or  help him, aside from giving him a place to stay for a couple days. She may as well not even exist-- the only reason she even does is to create more senseless tragedy for Subaru. \n\nRem and Ram are much better characters, as they actually have legitimate characterisation, backstory and development over the course of the story. The issue with them, particularly Rem, is that this development occurs so suddenly that it feels more like a complete change in character than an extension of who they really are. Rem  goes from hating Subaru's guts to being so completely in-love with him that she is willing to follow him to the ends of the Earth and sacrifice anything for his sake. To be fair, there is reason for this abrupt change in personality: Subaru is one of the only people who has ever shown her kindness, and he did so selflessly, on several occasions, without regard for his own safety. He does a great deal to win over her trust and respect. But the extent to which she loves him, especially when she was still cursing his name just a couple short episodes before, is so extreme that it feels less like a natural progression of her feelings and more a way to instil feelings of love in the viewer, to make her palatable to otaku, an ideal girlfriend of sorts, a \"waifu\" much as Emilia is. It is very hard to convince me that her feelings are anything more than a fleeting puppy-love when merely showing her a bit of kindness is enough to immediately turn Subaru from her most-hated person in the world to her most-cherished one. It feels fake-- it feels like a lie, as many things in Re:Zero are revealed to be.\n\nBetelguese, as creepy a bastard as he is, is by far one of the most obnoxious presences in the entire show. He is there, presumably, to create a sense of horror, as he will bend his body in unnatural ways, chew off his fingers in anger and bleed from his creepy little eyeballs, among other things. In reality, he is so loony and ridiculous that anything he says or does feels immediately silly, destroying any of the supposed horror he was supposed to generate. See, the thing most anime get wrong with horror (and indeed even most fiction in general) is that a truly terrifying character is not a raging lunatic, but rather someone totally ordinary and conscious of their actions. Hannibal Lecter is scary. Betelguese is anything but. If you want me to feel scared, do so in a way that resembles a reality humans can actually relate to, rather than a fantasy made of the likes of ghosts and goblins and bowl-cutted priests who eat their fingers for no reason. \n\nMost of the side characters are weak and one-dimensional as well, as they either serve as more empty harem material (with flat-out catgirls and lolis), are defined by a single-trait or  catchphrase (as Beatrice and Roswaal are), or are there as a weak attempt to instil more horror, like the stupid kid on the carriage (whose name I forget because I was too busy being angry at his annoying voice and how dumb the scene was) who completely breaks character and turns into a raging lunatic in another shallow attempt to push the story in a dark direction. The one main exception is Wilhelm, whose backstory and motivations truly do feel meaningful and justified. It is just a shame that he is immediately thrown to the benches again once this backstory reaches its quick end, serving afterwards as little more than some old dude who is skilled with the sword. \n\nThis leaves our buddy Subaru. I think, without exception, he is the factor that determines one's enjoyment of Re:Zero. If you can put up with his utter stupidity, you will find it possible to empathise with the trauma he goes through and his mental breakdowns that follow. If you are annoyed and disgusted with his presence (as I regularly was), it will be virtually impossible to care about most of what occurs. Subaru is the difference between being a fan of Re:Zero and being someone who actively dislikes it.\n\nIn many ways, he resembles a typical shounen hero. He is hot-headed, makes frequent out-of-place jokes (which I never once found funny, by the way), and refuses to ever think things through in a logical process, preferring instead to jump into battles he cannot win or to lash out at innocent people merely because his pride and fragile ego are called into question by his own mistakes. He thinks he is the coolest dude in the world, that he can save everyone through his own power, and the mere presence of someone with more skill than him offends him right to the very core. He yells and cries on a regular basis and seems incapable of having a normal conversation with anyone. Subaru is a child, and without any doubt one of the more infuriating characters I have witnessed in perhaps ever. There were points in the story where his characterisation legitimately made me angry and made me want to stop watching the show. Some moments were honestly baffling, too, such as how he switches from being completely mind-broken during the events of the fifteenth episode to being totally normal (albeit with a desire for revenge) in the next. \n\nI say all this, but the eighteenth episode is actually one of the best episodes of anime I have seen in quite some time. \n\nLet me explain. \n\nWhere the first two thirds of the anime spent its time showcasing unnecessary gore, Subaru's stupidity and empty characters who exist for little more than space on hug pillows and other creepy merchandise, the eighteenth episode redeems the anime and gives meaning to all that has happened, even if it doesn't erase its mistakes. It is an episode dedicated entirely to characterisation. It is a single conversation where Subaru shows remorse for his actions, recognising all the mistakes he has made and why he kept making them. He understands that he is a deeply flawed, broken person incapable of saving anyone or indeed even himself. It is at this moment that Subaru becomes aware of who he is. And you know what? I stopped hating him as a result, even if I still fundamentally disagreed with his actions and his character. He showed himself to be a human being for the first time in the entire story.\n\nI have great respect for scenes such as these. It's not often we get entire episodes dedicated to something as ordinary as a conversation. Re:Zero didn't need to use gore and death to identify its characters or make us care - it did so merely by giving Subaru a stage to speak. This leaves just one question: why didn't Re:Zero do this from the very beginning? \n\nIt's a bummer, as there was actually potential for a great anime. The pieces were there, and the writer and the staff behind the anime demonstrated that they had the talent to execute things in an effective and honest way. The music is excellent, complimenting Subaru's struggles without ever going overboard in sappy piano pieces and cacophonous orchestral pieces as many shows of its type tend to. Its visuals look totally fine, maintaining a consistent quality despite the longer-than-average episode count and abundant battle scenes, while the facial expressions, if occasionally a bit excessive, are undeniably effective at demonstrating the characters' pain and anguish. Re:Zero is very much a well-produced anime; you can tell that the people at White Fox truly wanted to create something special. \n\nI think this is why, even if I was bothered by most of the things I witnessed during my viewing of Re:Zero, I don't think it is a truly awful anime. It may not be a good one, not by any means-- its mistakes cannot be so easily erased-- but I do think its consistent effort and its eighteenth episode do at least redeem it to the extent of being a passable anime. It's why you see me giving Re:Zero a mediocre rating in my review rather than a poor one. I dislike much about Re:Zero, but for that one episode, I was a fan. \n\nI have a feeling I am in the minority here, as opinions on Re:Zero almost seem to be split into a dichotomy.  It is the best anime ever made for some, a life-changing adventure packed with emotion, and for the rest, it is a pile of irredeemable refuse aimed at the lowest-common denominator. To be perfectly fair, I am far more critical of Re:Zero than I am supportive of it. Its issues are certainly more numerous than its good points, and having one great episode can only take things so far when the other twenty-four vary from terrible to merely OK. But I'll be damned if I said it wasn't worth putting up with all the nonsense to get to that one point in the story. I just don't know if others are nearly as patient as I am, and I do have my doubts that future material will ever come close to that level of quality again.\n\nChances are, you'll have a better time with Re:Zero than I did. Many anime fans aren't looking for anything especially profound or complex in their entertainment, and I do not say that to be arrogant or dismissive. It is perfectly valid to watch anime for its entertainment value-- I do it as well, and so does just about anyone who is honest with themselves. \n\nBut this is a review and not a fan-piece. I am here to share my opinions and to judge the anime with a critical, yet fair eye. Re:Zero has a great deal of issues when viewed under these lenses, and none of them are insignificant. No matter how emotional its copious amounts of death and suffering made you, it would be quite hard to argue there is much more value to Re:Zero than its spectacle. It is a master at manipulating the audience's feelings, and while it succeeds at entertainment and has one special little moment, Re:Zero fails at making the case that it is anything more than lavishly produced, yet cheap theatre.\n\nThe question is, is that enough for you?\n\nIt wasn't enough for me.","episodes_watched":25,"scores":{"overall":5,"story":6,"animation":7,"sound":7,"character":6,"enjoyment":6},"entry":{"mal_id":31240,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/31240\/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/79410.jpg?s=88f029bf241fe102d4d75bc77cecba9b","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/79410t.jpg?s=88f029bf241fe102d4d75bc77cecba9b","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/79410l.jpg?s=88f029bf241fe102d4d75bc77cecba9b"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/79410.webp?s=88f029bf241fe102d4d75bc77cecba9b","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/79410t.webp?s=88f029bf241fe102d4d75bc77cecba9b","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/79410l.webp?s=88f029bf241fe102d4d75bc77cecba9b"}},"title":"Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Veronin","username":"Veronin","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/39613.jpg?t=1644993600"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/39613.webp?t=1644993600"}}}},{"mal_id":22681,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=22681","type":"anime","votes":3935,"date":"2010-01-25T07:34:00+00:00","review":"First of all, I have seen the original FMA and although it was very popular and original, the pacing and conclusion did not sit too well with me. Brotherhood is meant to be a remake of the original, this time sticking to the manga all the way through, but there were people who thought it would spoil the franchise. That myth should be dispelled, as there's only one word to describe this series - EPIC. I admit that as I've seen the original and read the manga, the pacing of Brotherhood seems to start off being VERY fast (I finally got used to the pacing afterwatching the first fifteen eps or so). Events that took up half a volume of the manga and had spread though a few episodes of the original anime were now shown in just a single episode. However, after trying to look at it from the perspective of someone who's new to FMA (not comparing it to the manga nor the original), I believe that the pacing works and it manages to tell an intriguing story effectively with little confusion. The plot is full of clever ideas and unpredictable twists that link various parts of the story together. By the final episode, all loose ends are neatly tied up and what's left is a hugely satisfying epilogue.\n\nThe animation in FMA Brotherhood is crisp and very well done (although it does sometimes dip a bit in quality). Compared to the original FMA it's a bit simpler but that's just because the original set a very high standard to follow. The facial emotions of the characters are also perfectly presented. The action scenes are brilliant and VERY well animated, with a variety of alchemy techniques and other talents being displayed nearly every episode. The various battles are consistently exciting to watch, but somehow get even better towards the end of the series.\n\nThe voice acting is of an excellent and consistent quality, and I think that pretty much all the characters have voice actors which suit their personalities. The majority of the openings\/endings are a pleasure to watch due to fantastic animated sequences and theme songs. The background music which play during the episodes usually fit very well with the situation, although some tracks seem to be overused a little at first. This becomes less of a problem as the series progresses, with plenty of new music being introduced to support the story as it reaches the finale.\n\nMoving on to the characters (best thing about this series), the original FMA focussed mainly on Ed and Al and on their struggles to regain their bodies, whereas Brotherhood also explores other characters to great detail at the same time. The majority of the spotlight is still on the two brothers, but it highlights their interactions with new characters which were not present in the original anime. New characters include a group of people from Xing (a neighbouring country), another person from the Armstrong family (who I think has become one of the coolest members of the supporting cast), and a new main antagonist. For me, the Xingese characters in particular (Ling Yao and Mei Chang among others) provide a new dimension to the FMA world, by showing us a different culture to the militaristic one we're familiar with. I think the new antagonist is an improvement on the original FMA, as this person has a much stronger and clever link to the Elric brothers' father. Returning characters from the original FMA, such as Mustang and Scar, are much more awesome and developed due to the fact that Brotherhood is 100% faithful to the manga. Plus, Winry Rockbell now has a much more active role in the story. I can say for sure that this anime has one of the best main\/supporting casts I've ever seen, and you'd probably find it difficult to label any of the recurring characters (whether they are good or evil) as being either boring or unnecessary in terms of the storyline.\n\nOne of the many good things about this series is that there has been absolutely no filler at all (yes, I'm thinking of Naruto, Inuyasha, etc), which prevents the story from losing momentum. All the episodes are concise and every scene is important as part of the huge plot. The dialogue fully explains everything and is straight to the point. As multiple characters are explored there are lots of side stories, but these are all perfectly intertwined with the main story of the Elric brothers and more often than not directly influence their journey too. Like most anime series, there are things from the manga which have been left out, but these are usually just restricted to comedy moments. There has been one episode which shows a lot of flashbacks of events so far, but that's forgiven as it shows the most epic moments of the series, and also provided us with some history on the father of the Elric brothers. \n\nFMA Brotherhood will be sorely missed now that it's finished. It is excellent in every aspect and has very little, if anything, that can be called a flaw (maybe rushed character development at first due to the fast pacing, but this quickly subsides). Each episode feels like it's too short, a testimony to how much it draws you in to the story and characters. There are moments which leave you smiling, laughing, sad and simply amazed. Try this anime, it's recommended for absolutely everyone, to newcomers and to those familiar with Fullmetal Alchemist.","episodes_watched":64,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":10,"animation":9,"sound":9,"character":10,"enjoyment":10},"entry":{"mal_id":5114,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/5114\/Fullmetal_Alchemist__Brotherhood","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1223\/96541.jpg?s=d23116b4bb6e0c2b45484fc9a43bc525","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1223\/96541t.jpg?s=d23116b4bb6e0c2b45484fc9a43bc525","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1223\/96541l.jpg?s=d23116b4bb6e0c2b45484fc9a43bc525"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1223\/96541.webp?s=d23116b4bb6e0c2b45484fc9a43bc525","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1223\/96541t.webp?s=d23116b4bb6e0c2b45484fc9a43bc525","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1223\/96541l.webp?s=d23116b4bb6e0c2b45484fc9a43bc525"}},"title":"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/tazillo","username":"tazillo","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/285183.jpg?t=1644660000"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/285183.webp?t=1644660000"}}}},{"mal_id":1371,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=1371","type":"anime","votes":3754,"date":"2007-11-21T19:18:00+00:00","review":"School Days is a psychological anime, number one, so do not think it is about cute children playing in school and having happy days. School Days is an anime about how cheating on someone can really end up messing with their head and lives and how the human heart and mind are very fragile and how friendship is very precious and when destroyed in the worst way, it can have the worst consequences. The main character is your seemingly typical anime guy in high school that listens to music and has a bunch of perverted thoughts about girls all the time, but who turns out tobe quite different than your usual main character guy and he has a crush on this girl that he sees on the train all the time and he ends up taking a picture of her and putting it in his phone. In class, another girl who he happens to sit next to, named Sekai, sees the picture in his phone and tells him her name and then, from there goes about getting him and the girl on the train to know each other so that they can try and start a relationship, all the while falling for him herself.\n\nThis anime is very much a psychological anime and deals with relationships and what happens when someone cheats on someone, but not only one person, many people. The main character is one of the most despicable characters I have ever seen, if not my MOST HATED character and cares nothing for the people around him, it seems, but to be able to hate him that much and to have so much passion for his pain and wishing something bad would happen to him was an exciting feeling because I really felt he would have to get what was coming to him. He hurts basically every single person he meets and cares nothing about how they feel when he is done with them, only to use them again in the future. He walks all over every girl in the anime, save one or two, and they all basically sit around begging for more mainly because they want to know what it's like and why the others are doing it, so they do it, too.\n\nThe majority of the anime the main character is, in my opinion, a sociopath, as well as a sex-addict, but there are moments here and there where you see that his actions actually do bother him and these are very important in this particular anime because if they did not have them, he would truly seem to be a monster. It is sometimes scary that the most evil people are not demons or supernatural at all.\n\nThe ending is something that is perfect, though, in my opinion and it is something I ABSOLUTELY saw coming, but the way that it was done was really something creepy and gave me chills - I really enjoyed it! It was an awesome turn, but something I saw coming the entire time and something I kept repeating throughout the entire thing, over and over again and when it finally happened, I was extremely happy and satisfied. It has a very twisted ending, as well, so do not be fooled by the innocence of the title because this anime is anything but innocent, but make sure you watch until the end because there is more than just one awesome, sick twist at the end that will leave you satisfied with the feeling you get watching the rest of the anime.\n\nEveryone basically gets what they deserve because this anime shows that the human mind and heart is an extremely fragile thing and that you can't just push someone aside like they are trash the second you are done with them because they may not be done with you or ready to let you leave.","episodes_watched":12,"scores":{"overall":9,"story":9,"animation":10,"sound":10,"character":7,"enjoyment":9},"entry":{"mal_id":2476,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2476\/School_Days","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/86373.jpg?s=2906152daa138b14f94d7882264f1fc7","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/86373t.jpg?s=2906152daa138b14f94d7882264f1fc7","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/86373l.jpg?s=2906152daa138b14f94d7882264f1fc7"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/86373.webp?s=2906152daa138b14f94d7882264f1fc7","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/86373t.webp?s=2906152daa138b14f94d7882264f1fc7","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/86373l.webp?s=2906152daa138b14f94d7882264f1fc7"}},"title":"School Days"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Yandere","username":"Yandere","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/9646.jpg?t=1644280800"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/9646.webp?t=1644280800"}}}},{"mal_id":318521,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=318521","type":"anime","votes":3638,"date":"2019-09-28T07:55:00+00:00","review":"*This review contains very minor spoilers* Does fantastic animation trump mediocre writing? When it comes down to it, can you ignore one to enjoy the other? As for Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, most of the anime community falls into one of two extremes. Either they love it for the amazing animation, an abundance of horrifying villains, and incredible fight choreography\u2014or they hate it for subpar storytelling, shallow character writing, and unfunny comedy. The truth is somewhere in between. Demon Slayer has some of the best animation of this generation, but I can\u2019t recommend the entire show because the writing is\u2026 pretty bad. Our hero, no older thanfifteen, carries his dying sister as he trudges through a snowstorm, crying out in anguish. Soon after, we flashback to before everything went wrong. We are greeted with a loving family. The scene is saturated with brilliant light reflecting off the snow-covered ground, angels singing with hopeful music. They are going to die. All of them. The cold-open is completely unnecessary. It is obvious this family with zero characteristics other than \u2018happy\u2019 will be killed. Violently. The lone survivor, Tanjiro, inevitably leaves them; now that his father is deceased, he is the designated man of the family. Upon his return, he finds his family viciously murdered. Demon Slayer never shies away from violence, and we learn this immediately. Blood soaked with horrific expressions, children protecting one another in their final moments, it\u2019s all the more effective because their deaths are left to our imagination. Tanjiro stares in terror, speed lines on either side of the screen. Aside from the maximum shock factor of a happy family being slaughtered, there\u2019s little reason to care. If you need speed lines to convey the protagonist\u2019s severity finding his family violently murdered, you need to rewrite the scene and start over. It plays out so predictably, and we still know nothing about him other than he was part of the happy family. He carries away the only survivor, his sister Nezuko, barely clinging to life. Soon she becomes the monster that killed her\u2014a demon. Tanjiro vows to avenge his family and cure his sister, by becoming a DEMON SLAYER!! It practically writes itself; a horrific monster-of-the-week for the heroes to fight off, and it works. As the demonic threats become bigger threats, Tanjiro becomes a more capable fighter. There\u2019s a real sense of progression.\n\nBefore his family was killed, Tanjiro hadn\u2019t fought at all. Somehow he barely knew what demons were. Demons are enough of a threat in this world that there are demon-hunting squads, yet this family didn\u2019t know about them. Thankfully through a lucky coincidence, Tanjiro gains new powers in a training montage. There was no character progression, but at least there was lots of pretty animation. Nezuko, despite essentially being a lobotomized demon, is trained to believe \u2018humans good, demons bad\u2019. Not only is this a cheap way to avoid writing character development, but it also raises even more questions with the internal logic. If people can hypnotize demons to be good, why is this the only time we see it happen? Rather than integrating this information into the story, it is dumped onto us during an action scene as if the author forgot to mention it in a prior chapter.\n\nTime after time, the action is undercut by the awkward dialogue. For example, a disembodied head demon ties it\u2019s hair to Tanjiro\u2019s weapon, then it is flung away and gets stuck to a tree. It struggles, then it says aloud exactly what we saw happen \u201cI wrapped my hair around his hatchet to grab it but it got tangled up!\u201d We could easily assume this from the shot composition and body language. Constant inner monologues, flashbacks, unnecessary comments, and awkward pauses bring the action to a screeching halt. One of the most egregious moments is when Tanjiro angrily stares at his friend being beaten up. Two minutes later, he finally yells and tries to intervene, cut to the ED before anything happens. They\u2019re like five feet apart for two whole minutes, and then it just ends. Early on, this was one of the main reasons many people dropped Kimetsu no Yaiba. Show don\u2019t tell is a rule that Ufotable can follow; their staff is loaded with talent and an unlimited budget. Being a manga adaptation, the moment-to-moment descriptions are necessary to supplement what the paperback art can\u2019t depict. However, a high-budget adaptation like this does not need superfluous descriptions. I frequently felt like I was watching an action movie with someone who pauses it once a minute to comment on what\u2019s happening.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Demon Slayer is action scenes, and one-third is jarringly out-of-place comedy. When it works, it is a stunning spectacle; the heroes run through the dark moonlit forest chasing after vicious demons, orchestral music excellently hypes up any scene, then the breathtaking fight choreography. The background art is beautiful, occasionally the CGI backgrounds are jarring. Thick lines around the character designs make them (usually) feel suited against the realistic backgrounds. Both the demons and heroes have iconic designs with distinct color pallets. I didn\u2019t notice a single shot with off-model character art. During action scenes, the use of CGI character models allowed for dynamic 3D camera movements, unlike anything I\u2019ve seen since Ufotable\u2019s Fate\/Zero. Occasionally, CGI models were unnecessarily used at a distance, it was still distracting.\n\nSuspension of disbelief is bent to the point of breaking in many of the action scenes, but many find it hard to criticize them because they\u2019re so damn entertaining to watch. Every time he unleashes his water breathing technique, I was always in awe; the painterly ink-like waves with lush blues juxtaposed against the photorealistic background look cool every single time. He has tons of different water breathing styles, each with different animations and usages. A basic slash, then combos, a 360-degree slash, and a mercifully quick painless slash to name a few. The whole water breathing technique that he uses to fight is awesome, even if the logic behind it is a bit vague. As it is described in the show, you inhale deeply, and it gets your blood excited! So what does that really mean? Even he says, \u201cI still don\u2019t get it.\u201d On the other hand, what\u2019s less forgivable is Tanjiro\u2019s super-powered nose. Even before he trains, he has this unbelievable ability. He smells emotions, he smells demons from a mile away, and he smells the invisible thread that allows him to make such accurate attacks. There are other unexplained abilities like super hearing; these kids are essentially the lamest heroes from My Hero Academia, except with no in-world explanation for their powers. Demon Slayer takes many shortcuts when writing its story and characters. If only those flaws didn\u2019t permeate through the best part of the show, I might have been able to recommend it.\n\nTanjiro is a good person. His ideals are unshakable. He fights for his family, he throws himself into danger to save total strangers, he even comforts the demons\u2019 tortured souls after slaying them. The problem is, he\u2019s too good. His ideals rarely come into question. After seeing a few randos get murdered, he learns that not everyone can be saved. However, nothing breaks him. Unlike most monster-slaying main characters, his morals never blur the lines between becoming what he is fighting against. As a shounen hero, he is what you expect, an unequivocally good person. That\u2019s why he\u2019s such a boring protagonist. Motivated solely by his desire to slay demons and save his sister, his personality is essentially a blank slate for the audience to project onto. Unfortunately, he\u2019s the best character we\u2019ve got. Nezuko, as adorable as she is, has next to no lines of dialogue. Other demons can speak, for some reason, she is gagged with a stick. During the daytime, she waits within Tanjiro\u2019s wooden box to avoid being burnt, only coming out when it is convenient for the plot. When her brother is outnumbered against stronger foes, she jumps out and decapitates demons with a dive kick. It\u2019s badass\u2026 but their unlikely partnership doesn\u2019t make much sense within the story\u2019s internal logic. In the first episode, Nezuko is a vicious demon, prepared to eat her brother, and somehow unlike any other demon in the show, she can stop herself. Not even four episodes later, we see another kid-turned-demon immediately forget about his siblings and eat them (and he\u2019s also able to speak immediately). She exists solely to motivate Tanjiro to save her, and that constantly made me think, \u201cWhy?\u201d Why does he need to make her human? She\u2019s in full control of her demon form, she\u2019s insanely powerful, she doesn\u2019t need that gag, and if she were a human, she would have died fighting alongside her brother. There are kindhearted demons in this show, people who were saved from death by being turned, so why is it such an issue? All I ask for is a story that remains true to its internal logic. She\u2019s lobotomized and nonverbal, but look at this cute demon girl crouching in a basket!\n\nThe emotional payoffs lack the impact the visceral presentation they deserve. Right before or after a \u2018boss\u2019 demon is killed, we always see a flashback to make us sympathize with them. Trying to get the audience to care about a villain minutes (sometimes seconds) before they die just doesn\u2019t work. They have already lost the fight; who cares if they had a tough childhood if we\u2019ll never see them again? Like most of the emotional payoffs in this show, there is beautiful background music to carry the lacking script, most notably the insert song in episode nineteen. Without the music, the writing isn\u2019t enough. All of the \u2018development\u2019 for the main characters happens in flashbacks too. Nezuko gets next to nothing. In the latter half of the show, the script has less time to be redundant. Instead, it\u2019s replaced with comedy. I hoped the other characters shown in the OP\/ED would be a lot better. Oh, how I was disappointed once Zenitsu was introduced. If there\u2019s anyone who likes Demon Slayer for the humor more than the action, violence, artwork, and music, I\u2019d sure like to ask them why. The characters are around fifteen years old, and that\u2019s who the humor would appeal to. Over exaggerated reactions, crying, yelling. So. Much. Yelling. Zenitsu almost exclusively speaks with a shrill yelling voice. The few battles he fights alone are so frustrating that I was rooting for the demons. His defining character trait is \u2018coward\u2019. He does get a flashback eventually that still does nothing to explain why he is so annoying. Nearly all of the humor in Demon Slayer is jarringly placed right next to series moments. People get violently killed, then within seconds, cut to the main characters in a cartoony art style doing a slapstick routine. In a series as dark as this one, levity is necessary to a certain extent; however, it feels like the author tried to make the mature themes more accessible to a younger audience by using drastic tonal shifts from horror to humor. The maligned tone made the show less scary to me, but only because it was so all-over-the-place that I could barely tell what tone they were aiming for most of the time.\n\nTanjiro sees his family in flashbacks when he needs motivation in a fight. In the climactic moment of the entire show, he gets a new ability retconned into the story through a flashback. Many argue it was foreshadowed in the ED\u2060\u2014however, the flashback explains a new storyline that gives Tanjiro a new power\u2014a retcon. Inosuke is here too, he doesn\u2019t do a whole lot, but he has more relevance than Nezuko, at least. Zenitsu and Inosuke are the most expendable characters. In the final arc, we get the most stilted dialogue in the entire series. A dozen new characters get introduced, each with one gimmick to their personalities. Overly cute, overly angry, completely nonverbal, they added nothing but fluff. Demon Slayer began with a roar but ended with a whimper. Even though it was poorly written, the stunning animation and grimdark aesthetic kept me entertained; it\u2019s a shame they threw most of that out the window for filler and unfunny comedy in the final few episodes.\n\nEither you will think this is one of the best shounen anime ever created, or you will think it has some of the worst writing in a big-budget anime to date. Perhaps even somewhere in between. You could skim a Wikipedia summary of the story, then watch all the action scenes on YouTube and you\u2019d lose nothing. I\u2019ll ask you one more time, are you willing to deal with bad writing to enjoy fantastic animation?\n\nWhen it comes down to it, you\u2019ll know what to do.","episodes_watched":26,"scores":{"overall":5,"story":4,"animation":10,"sound":9,"character":3,"enjoyment":7},"entry":{"mal_id":38000,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/38000\/Kimetsu_no_Yaiba","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1286\/99889.jpg?s=b32b6158766ca6e47557c857de0587c7","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1286\/99889t.jpg?s=b32b6158766ca6e47557c857de0587c7","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1286\/99889l.jpg?s=b32b6158766ca6e47557c857de0587c7"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1286\/99889.webp?s=b32b6158766ca6e47557c857de0587c7","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1286\/99889t.webp?s=b32b6158766ca6e47557c857de0587c7","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1286\/99889l.webp?s=b32b6158766ca6e47557c857de0587c7"}},"title":"Kimetsu no Yaiba"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/RebelPanda","username":"RebelPanda","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/4150781.jpg?t=1644861600"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/4150781.webp?t=1644861600"}}}},{"mal_id":87997,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=87997","type":"anime","votes":3339,"date":"2013-02-26T15:12:00+00:00","review":"I don't really want to go into too much depth, but I'd like to give an overview of the series and give my opinions it. If you haven't noticed yet there are many negative reviews out there for this anime, and while many of them bring up some pretty fair points, I think some people are being a bit too harsh on it. Let me explain. Yes it's a popular anime, yes it has flaws, no it's not perfect, but at the very least in my opinion it is enjoyable. The pacing is off, the beginning particularly feels rushed, there were moments where I thoughtI skipped an episode because of the time skips which made it difficult to really connect with any of the characters in the beginning, and there were some less than stellar instances where it felt like the anime was trying to make me care but failing hard. \n\nSome characters felt to be completely forgotten throughout most of this series too. For example in the beginning we are introduced to a character named Klein who is quickly pushed aside after the first episode and barely seen again and doesn't really make much of an impact at all on the story later on. This seems to happen a lot throughout this series where there might be some emotional moments where a character dies, or something dramatic happens but there is really no emotional impact from it, and the main character seems to not really care that much about it or it doesn't really effect anything significantly.\n\nI really felt this series shined from around episodes 4-13 and I wish they would have kept with that pace instead of rushing an ending midway and throwing something new at us. The second half just felt completely unnecessary and forced. \n\nPushing the negative aside, I found the overall theme and atmosphere of the series to be great, and being an avid lover the MMORPG genre obviously a lot of things in this series appealed to me. I really enjoyed the idea of being stuck in a game that was impossible to escape from without winning and having real consequences, it really made everything much more dramatic and meaningful in the story. Sadly this quickly goes away midway through the plot. \n\nIf I had to pick two of the best things this anime did well for me it would probably be the animation and soundtrack. They both were really well done, and honestly without them being as good as they were this series would have gotten a much lower score from me, and when I say I really enjoyed the soundtrack I mean that I loved it, it was superb. \n\nI think what it really comes down was just the fact that I enjoyed watching it. I can look at the flaws and pick the anime apart pretty easily, but those flaws never really stopped me from enjoying this anime.I really do feel though that it had a lot of potential to be a top tier series, it just made far too many mistakes. Looking at it objectively I simply cannot give this anime higher than a 7. It was good because I found it to be enjoyable, but it wasn't great or amazing. \n\nAt the end of the day I watch anime because I want something that will entertain me and keep me interested, and I feel that Sword Art Online did a good job at accomplishing that.","episodes_watched":25,"scores":{"overall":7,"story":6,"animation":8,"sound":9,"character":6,"enjoyment":8},"entry":{"mal_id":11757,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/11757\/Sword_Art_Online","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/39717.jpg?s=e418310b575f6afe9ac03b383527169d","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/39717t.jpg?s=e418310b575f6afe9ac03b383527169d","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/39717l.jpg?s=e418310b575f6afe9ac03b383527169d"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/39717.webp?s=e418310b575f6afe9ac03b383527169d","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/39717t.webp?s=e418310b575f6afe9ac03b383527169d","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/39717l.webp?s=e418310b575f6afe9ac03b383527169d"}},"title":"Sword Art Online"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/LLYNCES","username":"LLYNCES","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/1593341.jpg?t=1630966800"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/1593341.webp?t=1630966800"}}}},{"mal_id":175477,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=175477","type":"anime","votes":3295,"date":"2014-12-31T18:08:00+00:00","review":"Anime as a medium is known to cover a vast array of topics and concepts. Every niche group can find their own genre to meet their specific needs, no matter how obscure it may be: \u2022You like giant robots? There's mecha. \u2022You like lots of girls on your dick? There's harem. \u2022You like Nakama power? There's shounen. \u2022You like being mindfucked? There's Satoshi Kon. But where's the genre for catholic priests who need a quick fap before bedtime? Those who need to choke the bishop to some tender, underdeveloped ass? Well, I have news for you! No longer may the pedo priest suffer in silence. No longer may they settlefor lolitas. For almost like divine providence, they've been blessed with this modern masterpiece, Boku no Pico!\n\nStory: Little Boys\/10\n\nPedophilia. Yup... you're on a government watch list now.\n\nArt: Vanilla Ice-cream\/10\n\nIt's hard to judge the art since I had to look away at 99% of it, but from what I accidentally watched, the catholic priests will be pleased. Also, if you're a masochist, this is an ideal form of self-torture.\n\nSound: Moaning\/10\n\nI could never unhear the moans of a little boy being pleasured, God help me! These moans of ecstasy will forever haunt me! WHATS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!? The only thing that drowns out these sounds now is that of cop sirens as they pull up to arrest me.\n\nCharacter: Molester\/10\n\nFor some reason, I feel like Jared from Subway has Pico saved on his desktop. After all, he does like to \"eat fresh.\"\n\nEnjoyment: Psychiatric Help\/10\n\nWTF Japan, this is going too far. I could never see vanilla ice-cream the same way again. It's like a fever dream that creeps up on you from the mere mention of children.\n\nOverall: My Eyes\/10\n\nIf you want to be scarred for life, and I mean scarred like walking in on your parents having sex, then, by all means, go for it. This is the \"2 Girls 1 Cup\" challenge of the anime community.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, all joking aside if someone were to actually assess Boku no Pico, it's a tale of forbidden love, where the love interests in question are not accepted by societal norms nor its governing bodies. It follows an older individual taking advantage of a pre-adolescent boy, effectively grooming him under the falsehood of a mutual pact. The reason for the \"forbidden love\" angle is pretty self-evident given that a child's underdeveloped prefrontal cortex means they're incapable of giving proper consent, as they are still relying on a part of their brain that processes emotion and impulse, rather than rational\/practical longterm decision-making. \n\nWhat makes this stand out from other homoerotic content is that it doesn't try to demystify the predator-prey relationship or ignore scenarios that could give rise to it by placing it in the backdrop of a high-concept genre setting. Instead, it just presents it as a matter-of-fact occurrence, going through the bartering process of winning over the child with purchases, getting them in a relatively secluded location, and eventually coaxing them when they're ill-prepared to properly process the advancements being made. \n\nNeedless to say, this is not made for everyone. Even for the small targeted demographic it's going after, there would still be dissenters. It doesn't offer room for misinterpretation. It's exactly as advertised and shouldn't be taken as lightly as its internet-famed challenge has made it out to be.\n\nMake no bones about it, Boku no Pico is 100% deviant territory.","episodes_watched":1,"scores":{"overall":1,"story":1,"animation":1,"sound":1,"character":1,"enjoyment":1},"entry":{"mal_id":1639,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1639\/Boku_no_Pico","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/39497.jpg?s=c58de7803701e09f01c1aa75417fcb11","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/39497t.jpg?s=c58de7803701e09f01c1aa75417fcb11","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/39497l.jpg?s=c58de7803701e09f01c1aa75417fcb11"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/39497.webp?s=c58de7803701e09f01c1aa75417fcb11","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/39497t.webp?s=c58de7803701e09f01c1aa75417fcb11","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/39497l.webp?s=c58de7803701e09f01c1aa75417fcb11"}},"title":"Boku no Pico"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/ZephSilver","username":"ZephSilver","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/3955909.jpg?t=1636729800"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/3955909.webp?t=1636729800"}}}},{"mal_id":182712,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=182712","type":"anime","votes":3294,"date":"2015-03-19T12:52:00+00:00","review":"Hers was a white lie built on a grain of truth that snowballed as one lie after the other piled up. At first it was only hers, but then it became something that the two of them shared together \u2013 like a secret, a world upon which no other could encroach. He may have been \u201cFriend A,\u201d and she \u201cthe girl that loves my best friend,\u201d but they were masquerading around a truth that neither one could openly admit because ultimately, the truth was much more painful. Your Lie in April is a deceitfully masterful series that initially appears light-hearted and colorful, its palette boasting pastelsthat lend to the idea of it being another romantic comedy. Yet the moment we step past the disillusionment that it casts upon us by its false prefaces, we quickly realize that what we have immersed ourselves in is actually a tragedy in the making.\n\nTragic not because of a single element but because of all of its parts, and yet at the end of everything, this isn\u2019t a series about tragedy. It is a series about learning to heal, learning to move on, and learning to accept the parts of ourselves that we\u2019d rather pretend aren\u2019t there. Part of that is accepting that sometimes we need a helping hand to take that first step. Part of it is learning to say goodbye when the time comes.\n\nWhat is so compelling about the storyline is that it\u2019s not merely an adventure into first love, it delves into the reality of post-traumatic stress disorder, childhood abuse, and chronic illness. It doesn\u2019t paint any of these as artistic or tragically beautiful\u2014they are horrible, they twist people, they ruin the best moments, and they have a long-lasting impact.\n\nNo one is completely black-and-white; everyone has their short-comings, fleshed out in full before our eyes. They have their hang-ups, their strengths, their struggles\u2014and it\u2019s in these characters that this series really takes off in full stride. It would be enough for them to be multifaceted with equal amounts of depth, but they take it a step further in painting the reality of youth.\n\nOlder anime fans may critically analyze the series as an unrealistic approach to young teenagers, but that pessimism overlooks the reality of what it was like for us to be that age. We were all that point when we found our first love, when we thought it was forever, when we poured our passion into something that ultimately would not come to fruition or last. That\u2019s what being young is about\u2014and that\u2019s what Your Lie in April gives us. \n\nGranted that it may veer a bit over-dramatic at times in its representation of youth; there are moments of symbolism or hyperbole so overt that the cheesiness makes you shift a little uncomfortably in your seat (but I promise it\u2019s not enough to gag you). Given that this is, however, a rather common trope that runs in series with heavier themes, it\u2019s not necessarily a huge setback for an otherwise solid series. In the end, it is intended to be a fictional representation that conveys more than just what can be summarized in a few sentences or less.\n\nThe sound is completely on point, and the soundtrack artfully matches the emotions intended to be represented in each scene. From the actual classical music to the opening and ending, everything fits in like a jigsaw puzzle to give a full, satisfying final piece. When the characters analyze someone\u2019s playing as harsh, rigid, and stilted, we can hear this\u2014whether we are knowledgeable about music or not. Your Lie in April conveys emotion to us not just visually but aurally as well.\n\nThe animation is wonderful with bright, vibrant colors that bring the characters fully to life. There is an amazing, visually perceivable transition for the characters as time passes, particularly in regards to Kaori as the series moves on. It occasionally has some stilted moments but nothing outrageously noticeable to detract from the overall quality.\n\nUltimately, Your Lie in April is a story that starts out of the gates moving a bit slowly, but the pace matches the tone of the series. Structurally, it is a solid story of youth that dramatizes some aspects but never distracts from the intended message. On top of its other strong points, it\u2019s aurally and visually a joy to the senses \u2013 and to anyone appreciative of a series willing to realistically approach the conflict of childhood abuse and the resulting trauma in a positive way. It\u2019s not without a few setbacks, but in the end, Your Lie in April fashions itself to be a stand-out romance series that reminds us that while some relationships may be transient and brief, some people will come into our lives at just the right time for just long enough to touch us in a way we never thought possible.","episodes_watched":22,"scores":{"overall":9,"story":9,"animation":9,"sound":10,"character":10,"enjoyment":9},"entry":{"mal_id":23273,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/23273\/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/67177.jpg?s=30abc8a569b0f1251101e7f5a2b29609","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/67177t.jpg?s=30abc8a569b0f1251101e7f5a2b29609","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/67177l.jpg?s=30abc8a569b0f1251101e7f5a2b29609"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/67177.webp?s=30abc8a569b0f1251101e7f5a2b29609","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/67177t.webp?s=30abc8a569b0f1251101e7f5a2b29609","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/67177l.webp?s=30abc8a569b0f1251101e7f5a2b29609"}},"title":"Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/henyome","username":"henyome","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/236056.jpg?t=1642218000"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/236056.webp?t=1642218000"}}}},{"mal_id":163333,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=163333","type":"anime","votes":3283,"date":"2014-10-02T17:27:00+00:00","review":"The lack of popularity surrounding Hunter x Hunter (2011) has always confused me, especially after catching up to it six months ago. For an anime that seems to do everything right, it isn't talked about a lot at a popular level. Neither has it been successful in garnering a fan base similar to that of SNK or SAO. I decided to write this review to do the show justice. If a show this good is still flying under your radar or if you are discouraged from watching this because of its \"childish appearance\" then reading this review is a must. Story: HxH is about a young boynamed Gon who embarks on a journey to find his father. After learning that his father left him at a young age to become a Hunter, Gon decides to follow in his footsteps not only to find him, but also to see what was so special about the profession that made his father choose it over him. Although a story of finding one's father is simple, it is the path that is taken towards this end that makes the series truly special. HxH is made up of several arcs that are all extremely well-written, which brings me to the best part of the series, the writing. Hunter x Hunter (2011) boasts one of the finest writing in the world of shonen; the depth and flow of the story, enthralling characterizations, strong dialogue and impressive world-building are all crafted into a fascinating tale that can absorb viewers into lengthy marathons. \n\nThe amount of variety that is packed into HxH's story is also very impressive. HxH successfully dabbles in several genres in six story arcs tackling survival, fighting tournaments, crime thriller, virtual realities, war and politics. Not only that, the series is also able to undergo significant tonal shifts with ease (light to dark and vice versa). Sometimes, these shifts in tone occur after an arc ends though other times, it even occurs mid-arc. Another thing about HxH is that its arcs are connected with one another, with each arc naturally following the one before it. This creates a natural transition that highlights what the series really is, a journey. As for pacing and development, they are excellent. For the most part, HxH is very well paced. The series does a fantastic job at keeping its viewers engaged, time will fly by as you watch most episodes and you'll find yourself breezing through the show. Excluding two recap episodes, HxH has no filler episodes. Due to this, story progression is solid with the plot moving forward with each episode.\n\nAlthough HxH initially gives off a light hearted impression, it gives off a good one. Not the kind of \u201clight heartedness\u201d that makes you say \u201cthis is childish and below me\u201d but the kind that appeals to everyone. HxH gives off that classic and charming shonen vibe that has been lost in recent years, and it does so with its head held up high. Eventually though, the series takes a dark turn. Although most HxH story arcs are light hearted, both Yorknew and the Chimera Ant arc are two of the best and darkest arcs shonen has to offer. Yorknew can be described as a dark thriller in a big city. The central theme of the arc is revenge and it is similar to Death Note in terms of thrill and atmosphere. On the other hand, the Chimera Ants arc can be described as an attempt by the Hunters Association to control an outbreak of a dangerous man-eating species. It is the darkest and most thematically powerful arc in the series tackling themes such as identity, human nature and survival of the fittest. The arc has drawn comparisons to Yu Yu Hakusho\u2019s Chapter Black for its seinen-like nature and is similar to Shingeki no Kyojin, where the protagonists experience a strong sense of despair in the face of a vastly superior, hostile species. The series undergoes major tonal shifts in both arcs with the color palette, music, atmosphere and amount of violence changing significantly. \n\nHowever, what sets the series apart from other battle anime is its unorthodoxy and unpredictability. Shonen tropes and storytelling methods are undermined throughout the series. The main character for example, Gon, fails more than he succeeds. Power-ups based on emotion or willpower are non-existent and fighting in the series is radically different from other battle anime. The main protagonist is not the main focus of every arc either. At certain points in the series, you could even say that Gon has taken a supporting role, especially during the later portions of the CA arc where he isn't given as much focus due to the grand scope of the story. The standard battle anime formula of \u201close-train-win\u201d is also undermined. Although there is training, it does not always translate to a victory, nor does it propel the protagonists over or to the same level as their main adversaries in terms of strength. For the most part, the protagonists assume the underdog role. Although they have incredible potential, they are still kids who have a lot to learn. In terms of storytelling, unpredictable developments are commonplace. One thing that continues to amaze me with this show is how it leads viewers into thinking that the story will progress in this direction, only to change course and arrive at a completely different outcome. A good example of this would be the series' arcs which often end in an anti-climatic manner. Basically, there are a lot of scenes and story developments that you won\u2019t see coming because they defy conventional shonen storytelling or are unpredictable in their own right.\n\nThe series' unorthodoxy can also be seen in its fights which are primarily cerebral. In addition to being well-executed, HxH fights are smart and involve a lot of strategy. Raw power is a factor but it is not the factor that decides battle outcomes, actual power (nen abilities), experience and strategy are all taken into account. If a main character is outclassed by an opponent in all or most categories, he is likely to lose. Moreover, main characters are not given any special treatment in combat. This smart approach to fighting is further enhanced by nen, a unique and complex power system held by defined rules. The concept of nen, its principles, aura types and many applications on the battlefield reveal the huge amount of thought that was put into it. I still remember having to pause episodes, even research a bit during its introduction, just to digest it in its entirety. \n\nThe appearance and writing of the series also create an effect of cognitive dissonance, the simplistic look of the show mentally conflicts with the brilliance and unorthodoxy of its writing. As new viewers delve deeper into HxH, they realize that there is much more to the show than its cover art and synopsis suggest. Expectations of the series being immature, simple or generic are progressively overturned as the show reveals its surprising underbelly.\n\nSound:\nAs for sound, HxH has a line of great soundtracks that started off decent but got better as the series progressed. With the exception of a few minor characters, the voice acting in this series is excellent. As a person who has never seen the old series it\u2019s hard to believe that these aren't the original voices because they fit extremely well, especially those of Gon, Killua and Hisoka whose voice actors do a perfect job of capturing their characters. \n\nArt:\nHxH also has great art and animation. It amazes me how a long-running series like HxH delivers consistent quality animation episode after episode, especially during the fights. The series does a great job of capturing facial expressions and everything from the lighting, shading and colors adjust perfectly depending on the mood of the scene or the tone of the arc. As one reviewer (nagaiyume) said, the bright colors of the show might need some getting used to, though it is usually fans of the old series who have this problem. Personally, I think it fits the show perfectly. It adds to the charm of the series by complementing its sense of adventure, uplifting atmosphere and unique appeal as a shonen that looks simple but is actually remarkably deep. \n\nCharacters:\nAlthough HxH\u2019s primary strength lies in its writing, its characters come pretty damn close. HxH has a huge cast of characters. They have quirks, dreams, inner demons, world views and overall, really likable personalities. To top it off, most of them don\u2019t follow generic character archetypes. Although some may initially come across as \u201cgeneric\u201d, these assumptions are gradually undermined as the series progresses. \n\nIf there's one thing I want to emphasize in the character department it would be the series main villains. When it comes to characters, this is where the show shines the brightest. HxH villains are extremely well-written (with the exception of the Bomber who won't apply to most of what I'll say below). Not only are their characterizations independently impressive, they are also distinct from one another; no two villains are the same. This distinctness does not only apply within the series but outside of it. You won't find another Hisoka, Chrollo or Ant King in any other anime. This is what makes HxH villains so compelling, in addition to having really impressive characterizations, they are also original. Although I excluded one out of the four main villains from most of what I wrote above, all HxH villains do have one thing in common. Each villain strikes fear into audience, the series does a good job of establishing the level of danger these characters bring to the story and our protagonists. \n\nNegatives:\nHowever, while HxH is a great series it isn't perfect. The series doesn't have a strong start, it takes three episodes for show to get going. I've seen a lot of people drop HxH early and it sucks because the first two episodes don't capture the series at all. Things start to get mildly interesting in the third episode, after that, the series just gets better and better. HxH also suffers from occasional BGM misuse. There are odd sound choices for some scenes. Sometimes they don\u2019t really fit, other times they don\u2019t fit it all. Lastly, the Chimera Ant arc also has minor issues with both Togashi and Madhouse to blame. Togashi\u2019s fault lies in his writing during the middle of the CA arc which I think, pales in comparison to the rest of the series. HxH has made a name for itself for holding a consistent high level throughout its run; it\u2019s a series that\u2019s just so engaging and easy to marathon. However, I believe this consistency took a hit mid-CA arc (due to handling of the story and pacing) specifically, episodes 89-98. Don\u2019t get me wrong though, I think there are a fair number of good episodes within that 9-episode stretch but unfortunately, they are surrounded by mediocre episodes that break the consistency of an otherwise exceptional arc. Madhouse\u2019s fault lies in its adaption of the manga chapters comprising episodes 113 and 115, which were dragged out in order to have episode 116 handled by their best animation team. Episode 113 was actually well paced except for one atrocious sequence while episode 115 as a whole was generally poorly paced.\n\nA clarification about the \"slowed down pacing\" of Chimera Ant arc:\nIf you\u2019ve been reading up about HxH, you\u2019ve probably seen some people complain about the \u201cpoor pacing\u201d during the \u201cnarration heavy episodes\u201d of the CA arc. Well if you\u2019re wondering how much truth is there to this statement and were going to ask me about it, my answer would be it depends.\n\nAt episode 111, the palace invasion (climax of the CA arc) begins and narration begins to play a huge role in episodes in order to (1) pack a whole level of depth into the story and (2) increase dramatic tension. Rather than a high octane \"action fest\" people would expect from a shonen arc climax, the palace invasion takes a psychological heavy route wherein a character\u2019s thoughts and mental state are given more focus than the actual action. This psychological focus together with the narration slows down the pace considerably in the sense that episodes begin to cover a lot less in narrative time. However, despite this \u201cslowed down pace\u201d, the pacing of these episodes remain solid with good amount of manga chapters being covered during each of these episodes and the duration of scenes being on point (except for episodes 113 and 115 which I mentioned earlier in this review).\n\nIn the end, it depends if the narration works on you or not. If you like the psychological approach and experience an increase in suspense then you\u2019ll have no problems with the pacing and are in for one helluvah of a ride. However, if you don\u2019t like the psychological approach and feel that the narrator\u2019s heavy presence breaks your immersion then you\u2019re in for a grueling experience. Of course, there are other combinations such as liking the psychological route but not feeling the immersion or maybe the narration just didn't work on you completely. Well, if this happens to be the case then you\u2019ll end up with mixed feelings. On the bright side, most people who end up watching the invasion end up enjoying the narration. However, if you happen to be one of the good number of people who end up not liking the narration don\u2019t worry, only episodes 111-118 of the palace invasion have heavy narration. After episode 118, the narration begins to decrease and episodes eventually reach a point where they are \u201cback to normal\u201d.\n\nHeads up to people looking for action:\nAlthough I love the fighting aspect of the series and consider it to be a strong plus, I\u2019ll leave this out there for the sake of subjectivity. HxH does not cater to everyone. Although fights in the series are well-executed, they are also short (1-10 minutes) and happen less in comparison to other battle anime. Moreover, the focus on strategy in battles might be off putting to people who prefer fights with more brawn and less brain. If you're expecting an action heavy series like Yu Yu Hakusho then you will be disappointed. This is because HxH is a series that relies on its story to reel in viewers. Personally, I think this is how fighting in shonen should be done. Fighting should be able to entertain and also make you think. It shouldn't drag on for too long at the expense of the story without leaving you underwhelmed. \n\nConclusion:\nHunter x Hunter (2011) is an intelligent battle anime with a fantastic story, excellent characters and fights that involve a lot of strategy. Separating it from most of its genre, the series subverts shonen tropes and boasts unpredictable plot progressions that make it truly unique.\n\nOverall scores:\nStory: 10\/10 (Outstanding)\nCharacters: 10\/10 (Outstanding)\nArt: 9\/10 (Great)\nSound: 8\/10 (Great but occasionally misused)\nEnjoyment: 10\/10 (Extremely high)\nOverall: 10\/10 (Masterpiece)","episodes_watched":148,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":10,"animation":9,"sound":8,"character":10,"enjoyment":10},"entry":{"mal_id":11061,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/11061\/Hunter_x_Hunter_2011","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1337\/99013.jpg?s=05abf19e97b28707770c23aca11181f2","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1337\/99013t.jpg?s=05abf19e97b28707770c23aca11181f2","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1337\/99013l.jpg?s=05abf19e97b28707770c23aca11181f2"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1337\/99013.webp?s=05abf19e97b28707770c23aca11181f2","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1337\/99013t.webp?s=05abf19e97b28707770c23aca11181f2","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1337\/99013l.webp?s=05abf19e97b28707770c23aca11181f2"}},"title":"Hunter x Hunter (2011)"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Cresherhsm","username":"Cresherhsm","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/3174805.jpg?t=1458557400"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/3174805.webp?t=1458557400"}}}},{"mal_id":112811,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=112811","type":"anime","votes":3233,"date":"2013-09-13T14:47:00+00:00","review":"Notice: this review will contain a few spoilers. I'll mark them but if you haven't watched this yet, proceed with caution. Sorry about that. Survival games have always been one of my favorite kinds of stories. I just love them. So naturally, when I heard about Mirai Nikki's premise, I was greatly looking forward to it. Unfortunately, after an excellent first episode, this series began to get worse and worse; by the end of it all, it had become nothing but a huge disappointment. Let's begin with the positive aspects of this show. The art and animation in Mirai Nikki are, for the most part, rather good,but nothing very impressive. As for character designs, it's pretty hit-and-miss. Some characters look OK, while others are so ridiculous it makes the anime seem\/feel less serious than it should be, which is NOT a good thing for a thriller\/mystery.\n\nThe music is great. Most of the tracks are somewhat memorable and fit their scenes well. The OPs and EDs are also very nice, with the first OP being particularly awesome. I never skipped them. Voice acting-wise, everyone does a solid, consistent job, except for Yuno's seiyuu. I'm sorry, but her voice was annoying and hearing that infamous \"Yukki!\" every god damn minute was painful.\n\nNow let's get to the bad stuff. While the premise is amazing, the story &amp; script are very poorly written. Thing is, Mirai Nikki is a shounen trying (and failing) to be a seinen; thus, it lacks the maturity and depth needed to handle the kind of story it offers. Many questions are left unanswered, some of the writing choices are just plain stupid, half of the characters have a very low IQ and, for a mystery, there aren't that many twists, and those the anime DOES have are often predictable.\n\nThe whole concept of using Future Diaries to outsmart opponents in deadly, tense battles is BARELY explored, plus the battles themselves seldom involve complexity. When you've got tools as powerful as those, you'd think there'd be gambits just piling up on each other, but no. Many battles are over within a minute and are so basic it's insulting. Speaking of insulting, this show has a nasty tendency to have its world just forget about some of the big events related to the diary holders. Normally the media would be all over a series of bombings, massacres, etc... but here? Nah, it's just Tuesday again. It's astonishing how everyone can easily get away from anything.\n\nAnother problem with this anime is its bad habit of throwing in bits of humor in the middle of serious moments. It really kills the atmosphere and it's not funny. Even in the more lighthearted scenes it's not funny. Since we're talking about the atmosphere, have I mentioned that some details in crucial moments are overlooked, which obliterates the immersion? Empty hospitals, incompetent cops, silent bystanders...it's the little things that can make or break the mood. A shame, really, because the anime IS able to create a good, creepy atmosphere at times (ex.: the end of episode 3).\n\nRemember what I said about there being a lot of predictable twists? I kinda lied. The biggest twist in the whole story, which unfolds in the last few episodes, took me by surprise. Did it make sense? Well, yes, at least until the anime began to blatantly make shit up on the spot. Did it answer a few questions? For sure. Did it raise even more questions - most of which remain unanswered - and present to us an INCREDIBLY STUPID twist later? OH YES.\n\nNow for the worst part of it all. The characters. If you're already angry at me, stop reading because I will not be gentle.\n\nFor starters we have the male protagonist, Yukiteru (or just Yuki). This guy. Let me tell you something about this guy: he might just be one of the worst written characters I have ever seen. No hyperbole there. Not because he's a wimp 95% of the time - I can understand why. No-one normal would stay frosty after being dragged into a survival game full of maniacs. So why is he so bad then? It's because he's absurdly inconsistent. Most selective memory of all time, gullible when not paranoid (never with the correct timing), ability to forgive that defies common sense and, later on, he can't even settle on a personality (which seems to run in the family). Worst part is, his personality shift happens suddenly; he gets almost no development for 18 or so episodes then BAM! complete 180. If you're going to change a character's attitude, make sure it isn't baffling and that it sticks.\n\nThen we have our female protagonist, Yuno, the main source of yandere-ness, fanservice and body bags. THE poster girl of Mirai Nikki, to the point where she may be more popular than the show itself - just look at how many favorites she has here at MAL. The creator knew of this, so s\/he made her the most complex character in the whole cast and genuinely fun to watch. Unfortunately, that complexity only really shows up in the last few episodes, so until then she's pretty much a one note character - crush, kill, Yukki!. Moreover, the yandere trait eventually wears off, meaning she can get kinda annoying afterwards, even with all the carnage she provides. If it cannot wear off for you, then Mirai Nikki will be considerably more entertaining. Either way, Yuno was a hit-or-miss character for me.\n\nThe supporting cast - Yuki's friends and the other diary holders - is where it gets ugly. Out of the former group, the ONLY truly memorable character (and, might I add, one of the few characters in this anime that I liked) is the intelligent Akise. His personality and abilities are a perfect match for this kind of story, which is a shame because he didn't get enough screen time. The other three, despite getting some things accomplished, end up being inept at almost everything, to the point that Akise pretty much has to carry the team.\n\nAs for the other diary holders...just where do I begin? For starters, they're pretty much all insane or very dangerous individuals, except for maybe 2 of them; that alone raises a pretty important question: \"why did Deus even consider letting one of those crazy bastards be his successor?\". Another problem is that some may as well have \"fodder\" written on their foreheads: most don't even last for three episodes, plus they're lucky if they get a mediocre, unpolished back story full of cheap shocks to make you feel bad for them. \n\n*SPOILERS PRESENT IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPHS* What kills me is that some of the diary holders are such piles of stupid writing it's absurd. I mean, one of them is a 5-year-old kid who's just as messed up as the others, somehow has access to stuff like toxic gas and who can formulate rather elaborate plans. Another is the mama bear of an orphanage composed of people who are willing to erase anyone for her - dressed as ninjas, no less. Yet another is a blind Power Rangers fanatic who dresses up as an eyeball (and who can somehow bring dolls to life. Never explained!) to fight crime. Remember, this anime takes itself seriously.\n\nThere's also the eleventh diary holder, the Hitler wannabe who gave Deus the idea for the diaries. Since the anime never even tries to further explore such an important character, allow me to ask some questions: how did he (or any of the diary holders) meet Deus? Why did Deus even listen to this obviously crazy man? Why future diaries, and not some kind of superpower? By the way, why is Deus decaying? What is MurMur's origin? Why did EVERY ONE of the diary holders only gun for Yuki? The questions pile up fast once the characters are taken into consideration. \n\nWas there not a single diary holder that I liked? The answer is yes. That would be Minene, the ninth, the series' resident internationally wanted terrorist (at the tender age of 18. Seriously). She was pretty awesome and likable for most of her screen time, which made watching her turn into a textbook tsundere even more painful. And let's not talk about her ABSOLUTELY STUPID role in the final marathon of twists. *SPOILERS END HERE*\n\nWhat about enjoyment? Believe me in this one: if you pay attention to the writing, Mirai Nikki will be painful. The mountain of questions, the absurd decisions that some of the characters make, etc...you just won't get a lot of breaks after the first few episodes. So what if you employ the good ol' \"turn off your brain\" strategy? It probably won't be all that enjoyable either. As I've said before, this is a shounen trying to be a seinen. You can just FEEL it try. And fail. I don't know about the rest of you, but that really kills the experience for me.\n\nIn conclusion, Mirai Nikki is a huge disappointment. Its messy story and weak characters are simply not fit for the genre it belongs to. Even if the art was OK, even if the soundtrack was great, even if the anime has its moments and holds the potential to be enjoyable should one ignore the writing issues, it simply does not live up to the hype. I'm probably gonna get lynched by its fanbase; however, I don't really care. I'm done. I needed to get this out of my system, and there it is.\n\nThanks for reading this review.","episodes_watched":26,"scores":{"overall":4,"story":4,"animation":7,"sound":9,"character":3,"enjoyment":5},"entry":{"mal_id":10620,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/10620\/Mirai_Nikki_TV","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/13\/33465.jpg?s=e9dfdf42266b7cde5fff68bf4cd4252c","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/13\/33465t.jpg?s=e9dfdf42266b7cde5fff68bf4cd4252c","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/13\/33465l.jpg?s=e9dfdf42266b7cde5fff68bf4cd4252c"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/13\/33465.webp?s=e9dfdf42266b7cde5fff68bf4cd4252c","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/13\/33465t.webp?s=e9dfdf42266b7cde5fff68bf4cd4252c","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/13\/33465l.webp?s=e9dfdf42266b7cde5fff68bf4cd4252c"}},"title":"Mirai Nikki (TV)"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Seeyounextweek","username":"Seeyounextweek","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/2466649.jpg?t=1563202200"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/2466649.webp?t=1563202200"}}}},{"mal_id":223042,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=223042","type":"anime","votes":3083,"date":"2016-07-03T21:41:00+00:00","review":"Story: 7 Art: 10 Sound: 9 Character: 7 Enjoyment: 10 Overall: 9 I watched this film at Anime Expo 2016 Los Angeles. I'll try to keep my review as spoiler-less as possible. TL;DR: The film holds true to all the expectations of a Makoto Shinkai production, from heartfelt smiles to crying the 5th time within the last 30 minutes. His signature metaphorical use of trains, the idea of a hopeless and distant love, and beautiful scenery really dive you emotionally into the story, even for how generic and simple it may seem. Story: 7 The story is fairly straightforward; It's very easy to guess where the story will head, but that doesn't mean tosay I didn't enjoy it. It warrants a 7 simply because I felt a lack of emotional depth from the characters. This lacking depth makes me constantly question the characters' actions throughout the film, and because I am constantly searching for a motivation for their actions besides purely as plot devices, I am effectively removed from the immersion. However, this does not take away from my overall score which I shall highlight later.\n\nArt: 10\nAs expected of a Makoto Shinkai film, the artwork is beautiful. The production quality is off the charts. The art in itself is enough to evoke tears, as it did for me during even the trailer. His choice of colors and use of movement and focus within the frame really help you pay attention to what you need to pay attention to, while also not skimping out and leaving out detail if your eyes do decide to stray, which I recommend you do while watching any Makoto Shinkai film for every blur, light flare, and particle floating along the screen really do add incredible amounts of emotion to the scene. My friends and I consider most Makoto Shinkai films as \"5 Wallpapers per Second\" and for good reason. \n\nSound: 9\nGranted I watched this film in an auditorium with hundreds of people, I can't give an accurate score as of writing this review. I don't know who did the music for the film, but during the Q&amp;A Panel held with Shinkai, he mentioned that he messaged one of his favorite bands that he was working on a film, and wanted them to do the music, to which they said yes. \n\nEDIT 7\/25\/2016:\nThe music was done by the band RADWIMPS, a Japanese rock\/alternative rock band. Some people have come to me asking whether or not this took away from the cinematic or emotional feel of the film, but in my opinion it helped in a way characterize the characters of Mitsuha and Taki. Rock music carries with it a sense of youth. Bringing that youthful feeling to the film's soundtrack helps to establish the sense of naivety to the characters and their interactions. It really helps establish the characters as teenagers who don't know or care about right from wrong, but rather would do what they feel in their heart is the right thing to do, which is exactly what motivates Mitsuha and Taki in their adventure.\n\nCharacter: 7\nI wouldn't say I have much of a complaint about main characters Taki and Mitsuha. We all can relate to the high school phase of our lives, it appeals to us because stories we read or watch in books or films set on characters that are going through this remind us of our own springtime of youth. Shinkai did a good job at portraying them and their relationships. My main gripe is that I feel they weren't explored enough to feel a strong sense of emotional attachment. Their lives, personalities, traits, habits, friends, lifestyles, etc are all explored in the first ~20 minutes, I personally felt that we only skimmed the surface of these characters and are forced to go further into the shallow end of a pool, only hoping that it gets deeper to actually swim around in this world of possibilities. I wanted to laugh, cry, and even relate more with the characters, but I felt that I only read about them in a story, or saw them in a film (which I did). \n\nI wanted to feel they could have actually existed, but the film seems to be a bit too reliant on cliche tropes to incite certain emotions. The feeling I felt is similar to seeing characters smiling and laughing with each other, and having to individually accept that this is enough to establish their inner motivations, time spent together, individual goals, etc. I felt like it wasn't enough, and just had to accept that Taki and Mitsuha were the way they were. It felt sometimes that their actions were baseless and lacking a strong motivation to be deserving of the emotion the characters poured into their actions. As if acting on a limb to do something as insane as climbing a mountain alone. I will admit that this can be disputed, however, as they are still children\/teenagers, and we all do weird things for no reason growing up.\n\nEnjoyment\/Overall: 10\/9\nAs little as I felt I delved into the personalities of the characters, I did enjoy the film a lot. Shinkai's metaphorical use of trains just continuing to go along their routes that diverge in several ways really applies in this film, as much as it did in 5 Centimeters per Second. Everyone's lives diverge in different ways, things happen in dreams and are forgotten the next day, things happen in reality and are forgotten over a lifetime. I enjoyed Taki's and Mitsuha's struggles throughout the film to help each other, and as much as it made me well up tears in my eyes, I enjoyed his questioning of how much our memories make up who we are.","episodes_watched":1,"scores":{"overall":9,"story":7,"animation":10,"sound":9,"character":7,"enjoyment":10},"entry":{"mal_id":32281,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/32281\/Kimi_no_Na_wa","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/87048.jpg?s=bc9f2500ffcf2b7001801b0f5ed52e77","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/87048t.jpg?s=bc9f2500ffcf2b7001801b0f5ed52e77","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/87048l.jpg?s=bc9f2500ffcf2b7001801b0f5ed52e77"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/87048.webp?s=bc9f2500ffcf2b7001801b0f5ed52e77","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/87048t.webp?s=bc9f2500ffcf2b7001801b0f5ed52e77","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/87048l.webp?s=bc9f2500ffcf2b7001801b0f5ed52e77"}},"title":"Kimi no Na wa."},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/jgaaar","username":"jgaaar","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/2669141.jpg?t=1645009800"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/2669141.webp?t=1645009800"}}}},{"mal_id":9873,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=9873","type":"anime","votes":3049,"date":"2008-11-26T21:24:00+00:00","review":"Watching Higurshi is like locking a group of happy people in a test chamber, only coming back to find they've hacked each other into a bloody mess. Its horrific, its shocking, and yet a part of you, cannot help but wonder, how did it happen? The curiosity takes over... and so you repeat the experiment, knowing full well that those cute looking teenagers you just sent are going to end up as bloody pulps. But hey, at least each time they die, you're one step closer to figuring out why they died, it's all good. Higurashi essentially places you in the role of the scientist. It dividesitself into several arcs, each of which begin exactly the same. A teenager moves into a remote countryside village, and befriends a group of sweet fangirls that could have come out right from a harem rom\/com. Then, explicably, thing go wrong... very wrong. \n\nThe pacing is excellent, the suspence pulpable. You know terrible things are going to happen, but you don't know exactly what. Higurashi would appeal to two types of people. The maglomanics who cackle madly in seeing a happy community descend into the depth of oblivion, and the curious scientist who watched each arc with intense interest... for they want to know exact *why* everything goes wrong (though they can also cackle madly just a little).\n\nThe true draw of Higurashi is the mystery. The series will leave you guessing, postulating all manner of reasons why the sweetest girl in the class is now butchering every child in sight with a giant cleaver. Each experiment you run (arc you see) reveals a few more clues, and you formulate a new theory, only to find it shattered by another totally unexpected horror in the very same arc. The beauty of Higurashi is that a mystery of such grand scale, every detail is meticulous, and while every bloody event seems random at first, they all eventually fall into place\n\nNot only are the characters are memorable, and filled with interesting secrets, and unlike school days, they're actually also extreme likeable. This is no small achievement, given what they're portrayed doing to each other. \n\nHigurashi is really the pinnacle of a dark mystery. You'll start off the mad scientist, watching those innocents in the test chamber with morbid curiosity. Yet, slowly, that morbid curiosity will be transformed into sympathy, and as you fall in love these victims, that initial curiosity will into turn a genuine desire to figure out whats going on so that they can be saved.\n\n***\n\nAs always, I welcome feedback!","episodes_watched":26,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":10,"animation":7,"sound":9,"character":10,"enjoyment":10},"entry":{"mal_id":934,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/934\/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/19634.jpg?s=fe0990a23627f949384c98bb24082b0a","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/19634t.jpg?s=fe0990a23627f949384c98bb24082b0a","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/19634l.jpg?s=fe0990a23627f949384c98bb24082b0a"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/19634.webp?s=fe0990a23627f949384c98bb24082b0a","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/19634t.webp?s=fe0990a23627f949384c98bb24082b0a","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/19634l.webp?s=fe0990a23627f949384c98bb24082b0a"}},"title":"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Ceptryn","username":"Ceptryn","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/101649.jpg?t=1258388400"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/101649.webp?t=1258388400"}}}},{"mal_id":182775,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=182775","type":"anime","votes":3037,"date":"2015-03-19T19:52:00+00:00","review":"While there's certainly qualities in this show that are really good, I found myself rather unimpressed to be brutally honest. Story - 3\/10 Kousei Arima was a prodigy at playing the piano. He dominated every competition on a regular basis by playing the music perfectly as it was intended by the composer. He was so dominant to the point where he became famous among child and adult musicians alike. However, after the death of his mother (who was also his instructor), he was unable to cope with it and eventually lost the ability to hear the piano. He then quit shortly after. For the next couple ofyears, the world around him became dull and lifeless aside from a couple of his friends, until he met this extremely cheerful violinist, Kaori Miyazono. She revealed to him a side and style of music he never knew existed, and eventually convinced him to give the piano another shot.\n\nThe premise doesn't sound too bad. In fact, the way it handles the romance plot is pretty neat. It isn't just simply your typical boy meets girl and then they eventually confess, blah blah; there's a lot more to it than that. It focuses more on Kousei's development as a result of Kaori's carefree happy-go-lucky personality. The story is told primarily in Kousei's point of view, and likewise the plot revolves somewhat around him. Other characters do get screen time as well, though, and occasionally we do hear their take on things too. \n\nA big thing that really makes the story stand out (in the first half, particularly) is how it portrays the music. Why do we play music? Who are you playing for? What message are you trying to convey? Music isn't just there to pleasure your ears, it's used as a tool to speak from the heart. Who you are as a person, what you've gone through, and what you strive for are all expressed in how you play music. The notes may be the same, but the feel of the song can vastly vary with the way people play it. In other words, you take the music and make it your own. The way this narrative and message are pushed is rather distinct and effective in my eyes, and it was one of the few things that kept me captivated throughout the series.\n\nDespite how well this all is presented, there were still quite a lot of flaws, particularly in its execution of several storyline elements.\n\nMelodrama. It's alright to have it in moderation (it\u2019s a show about teenagers after all- there\u2019s bound to be at least some), but it was taken to a whole other level in this show. Almost every episode contains at least one overreaction to an event, almost to the point where it became hard to really feel the proper emotion you were supposed to in the particular scene. There were some instances where this was properly used and was actually beneficial to what was going on, but more often than not, I found myself cringing and unable to relate to the character(s) at all.\n\nPacing. The pacing of this show was all over the place, but generally speaking, it was so slow to the point where it felt like it was beating a dead horse. Literally, I could look up the word \"monologuing\" in the dictionary and find the cover art of YLIA. Episode after episode, there was an absurd amount of redundant soliloquy to the point where it became hard to watch. Again, as the saying goes: \"everything in moderation\". Internal monologue isn't inherently a bad thing, but it starts to parody itself when it gets overused. Thanks to stuff like this, it takes longer than it needs to for things to get going and actually progress.\n\nLastly, there's the comedy. Quality of comedy in general is unquestionably subjective (personally I didn't find a whole lot of it funny, but that's just me), but that's not where the issue lies. My gripe with it is that it was terribly misplaced. You're in the middle of this deep, sad scene, and then all of a sudden you're slapped in the face with comedic relief that doesn't fit the scene at all. To put it bluntly, it kills the mood. \n\nThe story had a LOT of potential. I, like many others, was hooked at the beginning, but found it harder to watch as the show goes on. It really makes me wish that this was a 12 episode anime instead so that things didn't overstay their welcome.\n\nArt\/Animation - 7\/10\n\nThe art in this show fits the feel of it really well. The characters designs are rather unique; they each all have full lips rather than a simple line like you see in almost every anime nowadays, and it's little subtleties like this that adds a sense of realism to the show. The brightness of the setting also appropriately fits each situation. The color palette often fits the mood of the scene very well; it's colorful and bright when things are more lively, dark and dull when things are more depressing, so on and so forth. The actual art itself isn't bad either. Animation was pretty solid and up to par with today's standards, but occasionally it was less than stellar.\n\nSound - 8\/10\n\nNow, I'm not a fan of classical music at all. I don't necessarily hate it, it's just not my bread and butter, but I've started to open up to it a lot more than I originally was. The OST is nice and really adds to the emotions that the specific scene is trying to convey. The solo performances are especially good for reasons I've already touched upon. I'm also a personal fan of the OPs and EDs, both of which suit the show well. Not much else to say here, really. It's just solid all around, which is important for a show like this.\n\nCharacter - 4\/10\n\nAs a romance and drama, the characters really are the backbone of the entire show. With the slower pacing, the characters get added depth, which is critical for a show like this to do. I must say, it did a fine job in that aspect. Many characters had their own backstory (although there are a few issues with this that I\u2019ll get to), and there aren't many one-dimensional characters that get major screen time. Most importantly, they all have likable qualities about them that make them endearing to the audience, creating an emotional bond between us and them.\n\nSomething that I felt was handled rather well was the development of Kousei. Being the main character, it's pretty important for him to be fully fleshed out, and thankfully he is. He starts out as a mopey, depressing, and generally dull kid, but gradually develops into something much more. After losing his mother, he really had no reason to play music. All he ever knew was to play it perfectly as the composer intended, and for the purpose of pleasing his mom. Enter Kaori. Her unique style of playing opened up Kousei's eyes in a big way, and inspired him to take up music again. His journey together with Kaori and friends has been helping him break out of his shell, and his progression bit by bit was superb.\n\nWhile I'm singing a lot of praise here, you'll notice the score I gave is again rather mediocre. Hear me out.\n\nMany of the side characters were pointless; their development overall pretty much either served no purpose and\/or wasn't done well. Often times, instead of adding to the story, their screen time swayed away from the main plotline which is not how it's supposed to work. Yes, I understand that people might think it's nice and cute to see someone else's story every now and then, but again, the issues I have are 1) it sways the show away from the main narrative without connecting to it at all, and 2) the way these characters are handled just feels half-assed when compared to how well Kousei is developed. If this were a longer show where separate characters could have their own little mini-arcs, I feel like this would have been handled much better, but obviously that wouldn't be possible for a shorter seasonal anime.\n\nAnother thing -- Kaori. This is kind of tied into the pacing, which I also touched upon earlier. She never really received significant development until the very end of the show. Up until that point, she's nothing but a mere plot device used to stir up drama. For the duration of 21 episodes, she was just a cute girl that's meant to be likable and appeal to the audience, but with no depth whatsoever. It would have helped substantially to show her insight on the status quo as the show went on.\n\nEnjoyment - 4\/10\n\nNeedless to say, I didn't enjoy this anime a whole lot. There are redeeming qualities that I'm not going to overlook out of blind hate, but overall, this just wasn't for me.\n\nOverall - 4\/10\n\nIn my opinion, this anime doesn't deserve to be rated as high as it is. Again, it's not the worst thing I've ever seen; there's several redeeming qualities, and I can completely understand why someone else would enjoy it. However, to be honest, it seems pretty undeserving to be holding the #13 spot overall at the time this review was written.\n\nI'll try to sum it up as simply as I can: for more \"intellectual\" (for lack of a better word) viewers who care more about logic and technicalities, stay clear. As a show catered for a younger audience, it\u2019s very clear more effort was put on style rather than substance, and that can make it frustrating to watch. For more casual viewers just looking to bathe in their feels, this is definitely worth a look. There are some quirky characters here that you might enjoy, and the relationship between Kousei and Kaori is definitely one that might leave a lasting impact on you.","episodes_watched":22,"scores":{"overall":4,"story":3,"animation":7,"sound":8,"character":4,"enjoyment":4},"entry":{"mal_id":23273,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/23273\/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/67177.jpg?s=30abc8a569b0f1251101e7f5a2b29609","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/67177t.jpg?s=30abc8a569b0f1251101e7f5a2b29609","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/67177l.jpg?s=30abc8a569b0f1251101e7f5a2b29609"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/67177.webp?s=30abc8a569b0f1251101e7f5a2b29609","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/67177t.webp?s=30abc8a569b0f1251101e7f5a2b29609","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/67177l.webp?s=30abc8a569b0f1251101e7f5a2b29609"}},"title":"Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/streetlights","username":"streetlights","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/4095049.jpg?t=1573359000"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/4095049.webp?t=1573359000"}}}},{"mal_id":1300,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=1300","type":"anime","votes":2916,"date":"2007-11-14T17:58:00+00:00","review":"Since so many people have requested this over the years and as there's a new system in place I'm adding my 2009 review for this series which was originally posted on my blog here on MAL. The 2007 one was written in response to the obtuse fans that were here at the time, and it will remain after the review as removing it completely would serve no purpose. It's also a reminder to me of something important. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the most debated animes in history. Some would argue that there are numerous hidden messages in the show, while others argue that it simplyplays up to a certain puerile idealogy of the world. Whatever the case may be, NGE established itself as the hot topic in anime for well over a decade.\n\nNGE first saw the light of day as a manga by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, and was published in Shonen Ace magazine from February 1994. It's purpose was to raise awareness and public interest in the anime version that was to be released in October of the following year.\n\nThe anime was directed by the famous Hideaki Anno, and is hailed by many fans as his masterpiece (although there are numerous people who disagree with this point of view).\n\nAnimation\n\nThe animation in NGE is actually very well done considering the time it was made (and the fact that Gainax was running out of cash). The colour palette used for the show was decidely bright in many ways, and at the time it contrasted well with the serious tone of the story.\n\nThe characters were well designed for the most part, but the real breakthrough in terms of design were the EVA units and the Angels. NGE pushed the boundaries of mecha design in anime to a new level, something which no other show of the time could achieve. It also wasn't afraid to show an enemy who had no visible relation to humans - something that was a rarity in those days (although Anno had used a similar technique in Top wo Nerae).\n\nThe animation in the show is generally very fluid, and although there are some notable flaws, they don't actually impede on the enjoyment of the show.\n\nSound\n\nThe sound in NGE is very good in general. The VAs in the japanese version are very good, and are able to deliver a greater depth of emotion than their american counterparts. The effects used are also quite good but never really stood out as much, partly because of the overwhelming visuals, and partly because they were generally stock effects. The music is generally good throughout the show, with a mixture of classical and other styles scattered here and there.\n\nOne of the most memorable things about the music in NGE is the theme tune. Anno had originally wanted to use Borodin's Polovetsian Dances as the theme music for each episode, but was overruled by TV Tokyo, who felt that this would confuse and alienate the audience. Instead he settled on what has become one of the most played anime theme tunes in history - A Cruel Angel's Thesis, which was performed by Takahashi Yoko.\n\nCharacters\n\nThis is the area where NGE failed as an anime. Prior to making NGE, Hideaki Anno had suffered from depression for a while, and the characters in NGE were created in such a manner as to reflect his struggle against mental illness. Each of the characters is flawed in different ways, something that was unusual in anime at the time. Given Anno's talent as a director, this should have led to some interesting, and highly original, character development. Unfortunately the show failed in this area because of one key factor - Ikari Shinji.\n\nFor many people like myself, the main issue we have with the show isn't the story, or the animation, or the sound. It's the characters, and in particular, Ikari Shinji. In creating him, Anno and the rest of the production team lost focus on the other characters. Shinji is not your typical hero in that he isn't, courageous, or handsome, or intelligent. In fact, Shinji consider's himself to be worthless. The issue I have is that the show focuses far too much on Shinji, almost to the extent where the other characters were simply plot devices for his devlopment, and not enough on the characters around him.\n\nThat's not to say Shinji is a bad character. He's not. The problem is that one can only stomach so much unjustified self pity (which unfortunately most of it was in his case), before wanting to slap some sense into the person in question. It's been pointed out to me that Shinji wanted to kill himself because he thought he was worthless, and that he should be pitied because of the bad hand he was dealt. I'm sorry but that argument doesn't wash with me. If someone truly wants to kill themselves then they will, so Shinji didn't really want to die. In addition to that, I know quite a few people who have been dealt the worst hands possible, yet they do not whine and complain about it (and many of these people did consider themselves to be useless\/worthless at one time or another - yet they suffered in silence for the most part). What Shinji wanted was for people to pity him and tell him he wasn't worthless, and while this is not necessarily a bad thing, it was over-used in NGE (to the point where I wanted to put him out of his misery - and not because I pitied him). The fact that Shinji's character has a tendency to ram his sense of worthlessness into the faces of the other characters is what put me off, as that type of behaviour is usually for attention rather than a cry for help, and because of the show's focus on Shinji, you can imagine how much I wanted to hit him afterwards. It wasn't that I didn't understand, it was just that they failed to depict him as an object of pity, and instead he came across as a whining, self pitying, attention seeking, and generally loathesome person.\n\nAs for the other characters, in particular Rei and Asuka, they did get a certain amount of development throughout the series. Unfortunately though, their characters, as well as the rest of the cast, were overshadowed by the mammoth amount of development given to Shinji.\n\nStory\n\nI actually quite enjoyed the concept behind NGE, as it made a nice change of pace. I did, however, have some issues with the convenient deus ex machina of Unit 01, as well as a number of other \"coincidences\" that were scattered throughout the series.\n\nThe story itself isn't all that original, and it has clearly borrowed elements from other sci-fi stories. What made the story seem to be original was the inclusion of psuedo-religious and psuedo-philosophical concepts, as well as the inclusion of \"Fruedian\" psychology. These formed core elements of the story, so what would have been a standard \"save the earth\" scenario became a dive into the psyche of the characters. The basic plot is borrowed directly from Space Battleship Yamamoto, and the idea of \"young\" people protecting the earth was used by Anno himself in Top wo Nerae.\n\nUnfortunately the story breaks down in several places. Anno tried to make a show that merged all perspectives into one single view, and while he managed to achieve this in some measure, he failed because he focused too much on Shinji, to the extent that no other options were ever considered.\n\nHere's what I mean. NERV is a quasi militaristic outfit, and as such, would generally have backup options available to them. The convenient deus ex machina I mentioned earlier effectively removes all chance for anyone else to come to the fore - except for Shinji that is. If the viewer is to believe that an organisation such as NERV was supposed to protect the earth, then they would at the very least, look for other options, especially considering Shinji's character flaws. This would effectively mean that they would have at least some combat veterans or trained soldiers who could handle the EVA units. The use of teenagers as the leads in the show was simply so that it would appeal to the teenage audience.\n\nAnother area where the story breaks down is in it's use of religious symbology. Many fans believe that what is shown in NGE is taken directly from religious beliefs, in particular Kabbalism, Judaism and Christianity. While the names used in the show may be true to those religions though, in many cases the manner in which the reference is used is actually based on Anno's own definition, rather than the religious viewpoint (something for which Anno has been heavily criticised).\n\nIn truth, The religious symbology used in the show was only really used to give the series an edge over other \"giant robot\" anime (i.e. Macross, Gundam, etc), and all of the various interpretations since have been ascribed to it by the viewers rather than the creators (something which is very well documented).\n\nOne big plot hole that I noticed, and one that should have been obvious to most people as well, was Shinji's isolationist attitude, and Gendou's reaction to it. It's obvious to any who've watched the series that Gendou feels little sympathy towards Shinji, however due to that convenient plot device using Unit 01 I mentioned earlier, Gendou needs Shinji to pilot the EVA unit. So, what you effectively have is the leader of a militaristic organisation who feels little for others, and a teenager with supposed mental instabilities. This being the case, why wasn't Gendou forcibly dosing Shinji with meds to make him more compliant? If your purpose is to protect the earth and it's people from attack by extremely powerful beings, and you're basically a selfish person with your own agenda, then conscience or paternal instincts don't come into it, you simply do what's necessary, no matter what anyone else says.\n\nIt's interesting that the whole \"psychology\" angle is only really supposed to apply to Shinji, isn't it? Characters like Gendou have been \"toned down\" because their actions would have drawn too much attention to themselves, another convenient plot device.\n\nEnjoyment\n\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is a tough show to rate. According to Anno, if you're a normal, well rounded person then you won't learn anything from the show. While this may be true in some cases, the things that one can learn from the show are juvenile at best. Many of the older fans of NGE have a tendency to view the show through the rose tinted lenses of nostalgia, and while this is not a bad thing, it inhibits the ability to view the show objectively. Many of the younger fans, on the other hand, are fiercely loyal to the show, and have a tendency to react harshly to any criticism of the show. The unfortunate side effect of this is that the show has gained a certain notoriety that it could have done without, and many people who watch the show for the first time, do so with certain preconceived notions already embedded in their heads.\n\nNGE is one of those shows that could have been great. Unfortunately the glaring flaws in the plot, coupled with the lack of develpment amongst the other characters in comparison to Shinji meant that I, at least, only found the show to be mediocre. NGE was a let down for me as I am a big fan of Top wo Nerae, the show that is effectively the older sibling to NGE (and is considered by quite a few people to be the superior show).\n\nI'm not going to suggest anyone watches the show, as that is a decision you should make for yourself. Likewise the choice of whether you love it or hate it is something that only you can decide. The only thing I can say about the show is that, when watching it, be as objective as you can.\n\nNGE is no Top wo Nerae by any measure, but it is a classic. Unfortunately, it really isn't Anno's best work, and the rebuild is making the same errors all over again. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd here's the review that originally graced this page. It's a bit bilious and lowbrow, but it served it's purpose - which contrary to what you may think wasn't to simply to upset the \"hardcore\" fans.\n\nOkay, I'm REALLY going to upset a lot of you out there with this review.\n\nNeon Genesis Evangelion is one of the most mediocre animes I have EVER seen.\n\nI watched this when it first came out, and I wasn't overly impressed with it to say the least.\n\nThe story is okay. The idea of earth being assaulted by unknown, quasi-supernatural\/technological beings is one that has been handed down through the years, the most famous example being The War of the Worlds (which wins hands down by the way).\n\nThe animation was actually one of the few plus points for this anime. The art style and use of colour made this attractive to many when it was first released. The sound was also of a high standard, and the catchy J-pop intro jingle was forcibly lodged into many peoples craniums.\n\nNow we get to the good part - the characters.\n\nAyanami Rei was okay as a character, but what on earth possesses everyone to raise Ikari Shinji to almost godlike status? The guy is biggest loser in anime (with the exception of Makoto for School Days - Nice Boat), and one of the biggest losers I have even seen in ANY story since Thomas Covenant. I honestly found myself wishing he was a real person so I could smack some sense into him. I've heard it mentioned that he is the most realistic character in the anime, and I have to wonder what planet the people who say such things were born on. I mean honestly.\n\nOkay, rant over, here's why this character is THE MAIN REASON why this anime was mediocre. NERV is a military organisation whose SOLE objective is the protection of the planet, by whatever means. This being the case, WHY THE HELL is Ikari Shinji the main focus of the story? He doesn't want to pilot an EVA, and doesn't want to fight. Any self respecting organisation WOULD HAVE FOUND SOMEONE MORE WILLING AND MORE ABLE to do the job. There's such a fuss over how special Shinji is, but surely with 6 billion people on the planet there would be someone better equipped for the job.\n\nBut I understand the anime only had so much budget so they couldn't really conduct a global search.\n\nThe most believable character is Asuka Langley Soryu, as her reaction to Shinji's ineptitude and cowardice is similar to that of any reasonable person.\n\nI'm not going to mention enjoyment as I've already made it clear that this was mediocre at best.\n\nThis wasn't Hideaki Anno's best work by far. Top wo Nerae (Gunbuster), was a far superior sci-fi anime, and the characters were MUCH more believable. The story for Top wo Nerae beats Neon Genesis Evangelion hands down.\n\nAs for his other works, watch Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou (KareKano or His &amp; Her Circumstances). Hideaki Anno proved his talent with this anime, and Top wo Nerae, so I can only assume he was suffering from dementia when Evangelion was written.\n\nA suggestion if I may, to end this rant. If you want emotion, trauma, passion, a great story, and all the rest, then watch some of the following animes:\n\nFullmetal Alchemist\nBarefoot Gen\nFlanders no Inu (movie)\nFull Metal Panic: The Second Raid\nNHK ni Youkoso!\nKareshi Kanojo no Jijou\nTop wo Nerae\nGrave of the Fireflies\nMushishi\nChrno Crusade\n\nThere's a lot more that fit the bill. Watch them, then re-watch evangelion and see if it has the same feeling it did before (I would advise removal of the fluffy pink clouds of nostalgia in your head before rewatching).\n\nSome of you are probably wondering why I wrote this review if I dislike the show so much. The reason is simple. I'm sick to death of seeing the show aired on the various channels that show anime, and I'm even more fed up with the fact that newcomers to anime are indoctrinated by magazines and other people into liking this piece of tripe, especially when there are far superior animes out there that rarely get mentioned anywhere.\n\nI'm going to end this review here. I'm not going to tell you all not to watch this. I just hope that this review makes you consider what actually IS good in anime.\n\nI hope I haven't upset you all too much.","episodes_watched":26,"scores":{"overall":5,"story":7,"animation":8,"sound":7,"character":3,"enjoyment":3},"entry":{"mal_id":30,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/30\/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1314\/108941.jpg?s=1bb89f56bd9a2ad35d34fb3fb5599166","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1314\/108941t.jpg?s=1bb89f56bd9a2ad35d34fb3fb5599166","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1314\/108941l.jpg?s=1bb89f56bd9a2ad35d34fb3fb5599166"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1314\/108941.webp?s=1bb89f56bd9a2ad35d34fb3fb5599166","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1314\/108941t.webp?s=1bb89f56bd9a2ad35d34fb3fb5599166","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1314\/108941l.webp?s=1bb89f56bd9a2ad35d34fb3fb5599166"}},"title":"Neon Genesis Evangelion"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Archaeon","username":"Archaeon","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/19870.jpg?t=1641472200"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/19870.webp?t=1641472200"}}}},{"mal_id":3299,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=3299","type":"anime","votes":2837,"date":"2008-03-21T10:21:00+00:00","review":"--The review contains spoilers-- Elfen Lied: Infamous for its bloody mess of gore, cruelty and nudity. A combination that could make many a person turn away. Yet, a huge number of people watch this, knowing (to some extent) what they're going into, and it's one of the more popular and well-rated series here on MAL. Some people call it a 'masterpiece', people some call it 'perverted', some people don't know what to say, and some call it 'horrible'. The first is true, the second is an exaggeration, the third is understandable, and the fourth is so wrong. The first episode starts off with what is the bloodiestand nuditiest 10 minutes of any show I've ever watched, and I'll tell you this: If you live through that, you'll live through the series. And vice versa. Lucy, a naked girl of the Diclonius race, a species of mutant humans with invisible 'arms' called Vectors, is escaping from a facility (more like assaulting her way out), killing countless guards and whatnot on her way out (all in the nude). When she's finally outside, she's sniped, but she doesn't die. Instead, two teenage cousins (the two other main characters), Kouta and Yuka, discovers her on a beach. She has lost her memories, and is only capable of saying \"Nyu\", which is what Kouta and Yuka names her. They also decide to take her home, and \n\nThe story suddenly drops severely in its gore level there, and slowly builds up again throughout the remaining twelve episodes. Along with the gore come cruel events upon cruel events, as more Diclonii and their sad pasts are revealed. Nyuu 'awakens' as Lucy more frequently as the story progresses, in the end completely reverting to her old self. However, there might be an obstacle preventing her from going completely psychotic...\n\nThe characters are all okay, though they do act really stupid at times (if you find a girl with horns lying drenched in blood on the beach, you don't just take her home and decide to keep here there, do you?). They've all got some back stories, which contents are mostly those of cruelty, blood and relationships. Especially note the latter; relationships. It's an important aspect of the series, as they are the main factor as to why the Diclonius are so \"cruel\" as they are. \"Cruel\" because they aren't the real cruel ones; that dubious honor goes to the humans. Treating the Diclonius as mere research subjects, being shunned by the very people who should take care of them, and being killed off for stupid reasons. Among the main characters, their love (there is a love triangle between Kouta, Yuka and Nyu\/Lucy), broken promises, lies and \"lies\" have all had their effect on how they are in the present, and what happened some years ago is connected to their development in the present day.\n\nThe series is only 13 episodes long, and in that short time quite a lot happens, which may make it seem rushed at times; it does move forward at a too high pace. The end result however, is actually extremely good, and a really tragic, enjoyable and gory experience.\n\nThe artwork is extremely good, yet very average. While backgrounds and scenic details are very meticulous and a real pleasure to the eyes, the character designs are way below what you'd expect after seeing the backgrounds. There is too little detail on them, the coloring is too bland, and they don\u2019t fit in with the detailed surroundings in any way. The camerawork is very good at times though; at the rare occasion it reminded me more of the camerawork used in anime movies rather than anime series. The artwork during the opening theme is pretty interesting too; I think it's based an Austrian painter (Gustav Klimt)'s works.\n\nThe soundtrack is decent, with a marvelous Latin opening theme named Lilium that fits right into the series' overall tone, and an ending theme that, while a bit more cheerful, fits in with the love triangle between the main characters. The background music during the series is very repetitive at first; just a bunch of instrumental variations of Lilium. It gets better a few episodes into the series though, but overall I feel they used the variations of Lilium too much.\n\nAll in all Elfen Lied is a anime that does a very audacious thing by having so much cruelty, gore and nudity in one series, but the end result is a masterpiece anime that wouldn't have been good without. Just remember that it doesn't have the R+ rating for no reason - events ranging from a man watching his naked daughter to a dog being bludgeoned to death with a vase and live dismemberment takes place.\n\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)","episodes_watched":13,"scores":{"overall":8,"story":8,"animation":9,"sound":9,"character":7,"enjoyment":10},"entry":{"mal_id":226,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/226\/Elfen_Lied","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/6883.jpg?s=55dec3cd95645db7dbd8b99201187aa6","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/6883t.jpg?s=55dec3cd95645db7dbd8b99201187aa6","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/6883l.jpg?s=55dec3cd95645db7dbd8b99201187aa6"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/6883.webp?s=55dec3cd95645db7dbd8b99201187aa6","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/6883t.webp?s=55dec3cd95645db7dbd8b99201187aa6","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/6883l.webp?s=55dec3cd95645db7dbd8b99201187aa6"}},"title":"Elfen Lied"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/TheLlama","username":"TheLlama","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/11081.jpg?t=1600353000"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/11081.webp?t=1600353000"}}}},{"mal_id":229330,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=229330","type":"anime","votes":2791,"date":"2016-09-18T11:58:00+00:00","review":"*Re:minder - This review contains some light spoilers* From my perspective, we are living in a time where well crafted anime with a myriad of originality and detail are unfortunately being released at a frequently declining rate. Because of this, many in the anime community are constantly on the lookout for something new and creative. So naturally, when an anime like Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu airs, a show that boasts morbidly unique twists on the popular but overused fantasy\/game world genre, it gains a lot of popularity and is generally well received in the anime community. However just because something is innovative doesn't mean thatit is a good show overall. No, there are other characteristics, such as a detailed plot and a well developed cast, that can elevate a show from being simply different to something great. So is Re:Zero a great anime? I honestly believe that it is.\n\nAnd not just because there's a totally badass adorable maid in it who fulfills the desires of every man's heart besides the romantically challenged main character who blatantly rejects her feelings for him. What a heartless monster!\n\nPlot: 9\/10\n\nI never thought that any anime would be able to effectively combine dark psychological elements with an upbeat fantasy setting. However the genius behind Re:Zero, Tappei Nagatsuki, was able to expertly mix the two seemingly incompatible genres together, and the results are quite impressive. The show begins with our protagonist Natsuki Subaru getting suddenly transported to a fantasy world after leaving a convenience store. Being an otaku who has probably dreamed about something like this happening to him for years, Subaru is naturally excited to be in this new world. However, to his dismay, Subaru quickly learns that he doesn't have any special abilities or powers. Or so he thinks...anyway, he encounters the beautiful half elf Emilia when she saves him from a group of thugs. Thus the two of them start their adventure. This beginning seems quite clich\u00e9d, however everything changes dramatically when Subaru soon finds himself dead.\n\nWell, that was unexpected. The protagonist dies before the first episode even ends? Really? Well we soon learn that Subaru actually does possess a magical ability, called return from death. However this power only works when Subaru dies. When this skill activates, Subaru essentially travels back in time to a certain checkpoint to relive that part of his life in order to change it to a future in which he successfully completes a certain objective and lives. Being a fan of shows involving time traveling, I was excited to see where Nagatsuki was going with this, and I wasn't disappointed with the result.\n\nI was initially worried that Re:Zero would end up getting boring with the protagonist constantly failing and traveling back in time to relive the exact same scenarios over and over again. However with each new life, the progression of the story alters, sometimes dramatically, and many new elements are revealed to Subaru which were previously unknown that help him to solve the problems he faces and move on. This kept the anime fresh and exciting since something different happened with each life. Also, with every passing arc, Subaru's situation seemed to become substantially more dire, which lead to an increased intensity in the anime that kept me constantly entertained.\n\nOne negative aspect of the show that I've noticed is that Re:Zero seems to rely and focus on Subaru's ability a bit too heavily. This consistent emphasis on return from death takes away from other things, such as the detail revolving around the royal selection. This is seemingly an important plot point, but it is significantly overshadowed by the constant focus on Subaru and his continuous retakes at life. The anime spends an episode or two describing the royal selection and emphasizing its importance in relation to the characters only to practically drop it and hardly mention anything about it throughout the rest of the anime. There are some other similar occurrences present in Re:Zero as well. This resulted in the loss of plot points that could have made the anime more well rounded.\n\nArt: 7.5\/10\n\nThe character designs are very lovely. They are usually rather detailed, especially their facial expressions and features during moments when their faces are zoomed in on. Vibrant colors also help to bring the characters and scenery to life. Unfortunately, like many other shows in the industry, the animation dipped in quality as the anime progressed. The most notable example would be the fight scenes. Those showcased in the anime's initial episodes were highly detailed and well executed. However some of the later battles seemed more sloppy and not as well animated. Also, the CGI used on some background characters was utterly appalling. Luckily the use of CGI is very limited in this show. But hey, at least the female characters still maintained their lovely features throughout the entirety of the anime, and that's what really counts, right?\n\nSound: 9\/10\n\nI was excited when I learned that Konomi Suzuki and Myth&amp;Roid would be performing the theme songs for this anime since I enjoy music produced by both of them. Overall, I think that the theme songs are rather good, with my personal favorite being the first ending, Styx Helix, by Myth&amp;Roid. The soundtrack was successful; it played upbeat and relaxing songs during lighthearted scenes and transitioned to dark and distorted themes during psychological moments. Subaru's seiyuu, Kobayashi Yuusuke, does an excellent job at vocally expressing the character's utter pain and misery through his voice acting talents.\n\nCharacters: 9\/10\n\nAt first glance, many of the characters in Re:Zero appear to fall into generic character categories. However as the anime progresses, the cast seems to evolve from their seemingly average state into much more dynamic, unique, and sometimes even lovable characters. \n\nSubaru surprisingly isn't some overpowered MC who can unexplainably beat every other character at practically everything. In fact, his only ability worth noting is return from death, which, while being extremely useful since it gives Subaru multiple chances at life, is the main source of his psychological trauma. Although he initially acts positive, Subaru slowly cracks and falls further into despair and insanity as the anime progresses. He is one of the few characters I've seen that, for the most part, actually acts like a real life human would in the dark situations that he finds himself in. Of course, this may mean that you'll want to punch him in the face sometimes when he acts all cowardly, stupid, and obnoxious, but you have to understand what the poor guy is going through. Plus he redeems himself in the later portion of the anime.\n\nEmilia is a beautiful, kind, and lovable girl; in other words, the type that many view as great waifu material. However the thing that I like most about her is the fact that she, unlike so many other female characters like her, can actually live WITHOUT the male lead. During one point she actually decides that it's best for her and Subaru to go there separate ways. I find this to be rather admirable, since it shows that Emilia can be an independent person who doesn't need to rely on others. There's not much else to say about her since she hardly gets any screen time in the second half of the anime.\n\nRem surprised me the most out of all of the characters. In fact, I believe that she's much more developed than the \"main girl,\" Emilia, and is simply a superior character. The first few times that we see Rem, she humorously makes fun of Subaru with the assistance of her sister Ram. However as the story progresses, we get to learn so much more about Rem. I don't want to spoil any particular moments, but I will say that she has a badass yandere mode where she slaughters practically everything with her spiked mace in an epic fashion. Rem also develops feelings for Subaru, who she becomes admirably loyal to and saves numerous times, that lead to some really adorable moments between the two. Rem is also super cute and she just looks stunning, especially when she smiles. The sexy maid outfit is also a plus. Re:Zero really showcases a rare gem in Rem, who is the best anime character that I've seen in awhile.\n\nRe:Zero also boasts a strong supporting cast. This group of characters includes the cute and sarcastic maid Ram, the adorable and magical loli Beatrice, and the utterly insane and slothful antagonist Betelgeuse. While obviously not as much as the lead cast, many of these characters receive adequate development and possess unique personality traits that make them more likable and entertaining to watch.\n\nEnjoyment: 8.5\/10\n\nThis show combines the best aspects of different genres to create something that is very entertaining to watch. It has fun characters and settings that kept me entertained. I was constantly on the edge of my seat in excitement hoping for Subaru to succeed and tensely waiting to see the repercussions of his failures. Cliffhangers were effectively used at the end of multiple episodes that left me craving more, though they were a bit excessive. While some episodes focused on dialogue and lacked any \"excitement,\" I still enjoyed watching them because they helped to flesh out the characters and gave me valuable insight on the characters' emotions, thoughts, etcetera. My main issue is that I feel like the anime peeked at around episode 18, and while the final portion of Re:Zero remained pretty good, it didn't quite reach the level of greatness that the mid episodes had. Nonetheless, this was definitely an entertaining anime from beginning to end.\n\nOverall: 8.6\/10\n\nRe:Zero impressed me. This anime wasn't afraid to take an overused idea and combine it with a myriad of originality that resulted in a very well produced show. While there are some minor errors (then again, what show doesn't have any flaws?), Re:Zero managed to succeed at being both an unique and a well executed anime. This is a show that I would most certainly recommend watching.","episodes_watched":25,"scores":{"overall":9,"story":9,"animation":8,"sound":9,"character":9,"enjoyment":8},"entry":{"mal_id":31240,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/31240\/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/79410.jpg?s=88f029bf241fe102d4d75bc77cecba9b","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/79410t.jpg?s=88f029bf241fe102d4d75bc77cecba9b","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/79410l.jpg?s=88f029bf241fe102d4d75bc77cecba9b"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/79410.webp?s=88f029bf241fe102d4d75bc77cecba9b","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/79410t.webp?s=88f029bf241fe102d4d75bc77cecba9b","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/79410l.webp?s=88f029bf241fe102d4d75bc77cecba9b"}},"title":"Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/HellLyter","username":"HellLyter","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/3813391.jpg?t=1644858000"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/3813391.webp?t=1644858000"}}}},{"mal_id":7905,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=7905","type":"anime","votes":2768,"date":"2008-09-13T05:30:00+00:00","review":"From Makoto Shinkai (Voices of a Distant Star, The Place Promised in Our Early Days) comes 5 Centimetes per Second, a movie that tells the story of two childhood friends in love, and how they try to keep their relationship going through hardships that life throws at them. Throogh three small stories, or episodes as they're called, we're told the tale of how they grow up and farther away from each other. The movie tells of a love that's slowly torn apart because the lovers move further away, both in heart and home. It's underlying themes are beautifully incorporated into the story; about growing up, lettinggo of an unreachable past, and taking control of one's own life. Though they're not necessarily very obvious throughout the movie, the final scene symbolizes these themes, and what the main characters decided on in the end. \n\nThe character we follow through the movie is Takaki Tohno, and we get to see how he looks on the events that unfold as a child, a teenager and finally, and adult. We see how he develops through these stages of life, and how it all relates to his childhood friend and love, Akari Shinohara.\n\nThe emotions are protrayed in an incredibly beautiful and realistic way; how they portray the love between Akari and Takaki, how they portray the girl who has a crush on Tohno during his high school years, Kanae Sumida, and finally, how they portray their development from children to adults all makes them characters you'll place your heart with. They're characters you'll love, feel sad with, and you'll wish for them to live happily.\n\nThe animation quality is astounding, from the detail in backgrounds to the astounding ligthing effects and camera angles that help bring the mood of the scenes to a level different from mostly anything else. The only beef I have is that the characters' faces lost a bit of detail from time to time, but aside that the movie is a visual pleasure that goes beyond pretty much everything I've ever experienced.\n\nTenmon, who's made the soundtrack to other Shinaki films, does an astounding job on the soundtrack for the movie, with piano pieces that effectively and beautifully amplifies the mood of the movie, be it melancholy, calmness or nostalgia. However, if you don't like piano soundtracks, chances are you'll not like it, since it's mostly the piano that's used throughout the movie (I love them though, and that's what made me give it a 10).\n\nThe seiyuu also do a marvelous job of portraying the characters, their emotions and age. I've only watched the Japanese version of the movie, so I can't say anything about the quality of the English voice acting. But I'd recommend it in Japanese anyways =)\n\n5 cm per Second is a movie that takes a story of growing up and makes it into something that cannot be described as anything less than a masterpiece, with astounding themes, storytelling, art and sound. If someone told me I could watch one movie before I died, I'd undoubtedly choose this one.\n\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)","episodes_watched":3,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":9,"animation":10,"sound":10,"character":9,"enjoyment":10},"entry":{"mal_id":1689,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1689\/Byousoku_5_Centimeter","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1410\/112994.jpg?s=8ad4a3776584bb348e6ae1403c28a36e","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1410\/112994t.jpg?s=8ad4a3776584bb348e6ae1403c28a36e","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1410\/112994l.jpg?s=8ad4a3776584bb348e6ae1403c28a36e"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1410\/112994.webp?s=8ad4a3776584bb348e6ae1403c28a36e","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1410\/112994t.webp?s=8ad4a3776584bb348e6ae1403c28a36e","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1410\/112994l.webp?s=8ad4a3776584bb348e6ae1403c28a36e"}},"title":"Byousoku 5 Centimeter"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/TheLlama","username":"TheLlama","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/11081.jpg?t=1600353000"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/11081.webp?t=1600353000"}}}},{"mal_id":191420,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=191420","type":"anime","votes":2544,"date":"2015-06-27T03:55:00+00:00","review":"I don\u2019t know about you, but my high school years were\u2026 not very exciting. I spent a lot of time by myself, reading in the corner of the classroom or somewhere quiet in the library at lunch. I had a group of friends, yeah, but there were only a few that I\u2019d ever really talk to. Even then, I\u2019d always decline if they ever asked me to go out somewhere, telling them about how busy I was or how I \u201chad other plans\u201d. I never said much. I remember a few of my classmates sometimes asking why I was so quiet all the time, whyI only tried to just sit there and read. I never knew how to answer. That was just how I was, I guess \u2013 I didn\u2019t like talking, and I wasn\u2019t very comfortable around most people. Why? I\u2019d tell you I was shy, but I wouldn\u2019t be saying very much. And it\u2019s not like I was bullied or anything \u2013 no one picked on me or hated me in particular. I might\u2019ve preferred being by myself, sure, but I still had a few friends \u2013 it wasn\u2019t like I hated being around people. I think someone called me mute once. \n\nIt\u2019s been almost a year since I graduated and I\u2019ve\u2026 moved on\u2026 since then, but I\u2019d be lying if I said it\u2019s all just in the past. When we graduated, that was that \u2013 some of us went to the same university, some didn\u2019t. I ended up cutting ties with most of those who didn\u2019t, and I still don\u2019t find myself talking a whole lot with those who did. But, hey, at the very least I\u2019ve come to realise how silly I used to be, trying to stay away from people like the plague \u2013 it\u2019s all just a natural part of growing up, and only now did I get the chance to finally join the club. \n\nOreGairu understands this. All of it. Everything. You see it in the slight furrow of Hikigaya\u2019s brow as his head rests on his palm, eyes brooding over to the noisiest parts of the classroom. You see it in the droop of his shoulders, hands finding solace where his trouser pockets were, as his bag bounces in perfect rhythm to each of his slow, dreary steps. OreGairu knows what it\u2019s like to sit in that corner of the classroom, by yourself, never talking, with you finding your mouth a little stale when it\u2019s time to leave because it\u2019s been closed for so long. It\u2019s just that OreGairu\u2026 does not think these things are silly. \n\nPeople are weird. We say one thing when we mean the opposite, we\u2019re quick to find flaws but we\u2019re not quick to trust. We\u2019re nasty for the sake of nastiness, and we\u2019re still all sorts of vicious to others even when we don\u2019t know it. People are complex and hard to understand, incredibly strange and all sorts of unpredictable \u2013 no one plays by exactly the same rules, and we will never reach a perfect understanding of each other no matter how hard we try. I\u2019m with Hikigaya on this one: why do we still keep trying to get caught up in this mess when we know it\u2019ll just cause us all sorts of problems later? \n\n\u2026Or that\u2019s what I\u2019d be saying a year ago, at least. Because to someone like Hikigaya \u2013 someone like me, in the past \u2013 we can\u2019t explain why people find themselves inevitably drawn to each other anyway. \n\nBecause to OreGairu, you don\u2019t need to.\n\nIt\u2019s how when you strip away all of his self-defeating cynicism and hateful snark, Hikigaya is actually a pretty ordinary teenage boy, with all the same desire, jealousy, and fear as any other. We see it when he\u2019s with Komachi: he\u2019s not with the outside world anymore, he\u2019s with someone he knows. He\u2019s calm, he\u2019s open, and she listens while he lets out all of his deepest wounds, all of his most buried secrets. It\u2019s no surprise, of course, when they\u2019re family \u2013 they\u2019ve been there for each other for fifteen years, and they\u2019ll be there for another fifteen more. Hikigaya says he lives the way he does because he has no other choice, but that\u2019s not true \u2013 he lives the way he does because he doesn\u2019t trust the world enough to share himself with it, to share the Hikigaya that banters so naturally and playfully with his little sister. \n\nBut it\u2019s a slow process. OreGairu only manages to give us a vague eventuality, a \u201cone day he\u2019ll change\u201d kind of thing, because it takes actually spending time with your closest friends to realise how far you\u2019ve managed to distance yourself from them in the first place. Hikigaya\u2019s finally starting to open himself up to the world, even if just a little, and through OreGairu we see how that can have profound effects on other people. Even then, he still doesn\u2019t get anything more from those who aren\u2019t close to him than a \u201cyou\u2019ve kinda changed\u201d, with them finding him only slightly less boring to look at. Because\u2026 that\u2019s how it is. Because it\u2019s the small things like that that show how, someday, maybe when he\u2019s dusting off one of his old yearbooks he found in his garage, he\u2019ll be able to look back on this moment as just an embarrassing memory \u2013 when he could say he was more open, honest, and true to himself than ever before.  \n\nMy birthday\u2019s coming up in a few weeks. I\u2019ve never been to many parties, but maybe I\u2019ll invite a few people to a movie or something. I know I won\u2019t change in a week, and I certainly won\u2019t change tomorrow, but in a year, maybe two, I might not be saying the same. OreGairu gave me a chance, and I\u2019m not letting it go. But I can thank it later. For now, it\u2019s time to turn OreGairu off \u2013 I have some old friends to catch up on.","episodes_watched":13,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":10,"animation":9,"sound":7,"character":10,"enjoyment":10},"entry":{"mal_id":23847,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/23847\/Yahari_Ore_no_Seishun_Love_Comedy_wa_Machigatteiru_Zoku","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/75376.jpg?s=9e5b6445bf9aab060a3455e23077aaf9","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/75376t.jpg?s=9e5b6445bf9aab060a3455e23077aaf9","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/75376l.jpg?s=9e5b6445bf9aab060a3455e23077aaf9"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/75376.webp?s=9e5b6445bf9aab060a3455e23077aaf9","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/75376t.webp?s=9e5b6445bf9aab060a3455e23077aaf9","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/75376l.webp?s=9e5b6445bf9aab060a3455e23077aaf9"}},"title":"Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru.

Part of the reason for this is because our scientific understanding of \"reality\" is still in its infancy, and this means that the writers for shows like Doctor Who, Quantum Leap, even Star Trek, must apply their imagination and creativity in order to resolve some of theinherent paradoxes that will occur whenever a narrative decides to hop, skip or jump.\n\nIn other words, they make it up.\n\nMore often than not the implausibility of any sort of time travel is camouflaged with pseudo-science, techno-babble, and a good smattering of conversational quantum-hokum. These add a veneer of believability so that the average person can achieve the suspension of disbelief required to buy into the storyline. When it comes to anime though, the concept of travelling through time has generally lacked in substance, delivery, and even narrative relevance.\n\nUntil now ...\n\nOriginally a visual novel by 5pb and Nitroplus, Steins;Gate tells the story of Okabe Rintaro (the self styled mad scientist known as Hououin Kyouma), and his \"colleagues\" at the Future Gadget Laboratory, Hashida \"Daru\" Itaru and Shiina Mayuri. Okabe spends his days making strange inventions with Daru, and the oddest one so far is the Phone Microwave [name subject to change]. At first it seems as though this device does nothing more than turn bananas into a green, jelly-like substance, but it has a hidden side effect that no one knows about. Everything seems placid and normal until the day that Okabe and Mayuri decide to attend a lecture given by the eminent Professor Nakabachi on the subject of time machines and time travel.\n\nFor the most part Steins;Gate is a surprisingly well thought out series that applies the notion of cause and effect in a reasonably intelligent manner. The plot follows a logical, if somewhat timeworn progression, and while there are numerous recycles, repeats, reboots, and \"do overs\" that form an integral part of any time travel tale, these are handled in a way that would have turned Endless Eight from tedium incarnate into an arc that was at least watchable. The show throws around a number of concepts and theories to explain or justify certain  aspects of the science fiction, and on quite a few occasions these have been woven into the main body of the plot very well. Ideas like the Butterfly Effect (which, given the visual cues, should be obvious to anyone), the Observer Effect and Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat have been used to support the problems caused by time travel (and their resolution), and in that respect Steins;Gate deserves a good deal of praise for trying to use science to support the science fiction (and it does it far better than the likes of Puella Magi Madoka Magica).\n\nUnfortunately it's not all fun and games.\n\nOne of the problems within the narrative is the inevitable conflict between human drama and science fiction, and in true anime fashion the emotional side wins out. This has the unfortunate effect of removing much of the chaos that is inherent in a story about time travel, and replacing it with predictability and melodrama. Thankfully the human side of the tale is handled in a surprisingly decent manner, but this is tempered by the fact that a number of basic questions are never actually addressed. The very nature of this anime automatically requires that certain aspects be resolved or explained, and while there are all sorts of \"scientific\" reasons flying around, the series tends to shy away from tackling certain first order issues like the Grandfather Paradox.\n\nThere's also the matter of the rather \"neat\" ending, but we'll get to that in a bit.\n\nSteins;Gate is a very good looking series, but as with any adaptation from another visual medium, there's an automatic limitation placed on aspects like character design. That said, White Fox have produced a series that viewers may find appealing, if a little generic at times, and have used what they've been given to very good effect. The character animation is of a high standard, and many of the visual effects are imaginative and well choreographed (which should be no surprise given that White Fox also produced Tears to Tiara and Katanagatari). It's unfortunate then, that the typical anime mentality comes to the fore in the little details, the main one being the distinct lack of variety where clothing is concerned. Everyone seems to have only one outfit, which may seem a little picky to some, but imagine how you would feel if you wore the same underwear for three weeks while running around and in mostly warm weather.\n\nThis mentality also comes to the fore in the script, and while the majority of the dialogue in the show is actually pretty good, the usual shenanigans come out to play at times when there really doesn't need to be any more drama. Thankfully the voice actors are experienced enough to know how to deal with the scriptwriters' attempts at overcompensating for various shortcomings, and in truth they're the ones that carry this series. If it wasn't for the talents of Miyano Mamoru, Imai Asami, Seki Tomokazu, Hanazawa Kana, and the rest of the cast, Steins;Gate would quickly collapse under its own weight, and it's thanks to the seiyuu's abilities that the more technical or scientific portions of the script can be delivered in a manner that fits with the narrative.\n\nThe opening sequence features Hacking The Gate by Ito Kanako, a fairly average J-pop track track that has been set to a montage of most of the characters who seem to be deep in contemplation while a variety of clock faces, cogs and technical looking diagrams zip around the screen. On the other hand, The Twelve Time Governing Covenants by Sakakibara Yui works rather well as the  closing theme, and for the most part the end sequence is a far more subtle and off kilter affair that is more in tune with the atmosphere of the series proper (until the last few seconds that is, and one has to wonder about the mentality of the person who thought ending the sequence like that was a good idea).\n\nAs for the background music, there's a rather nice variety of tracks that are often very subtly used. More often than not the series relies on mundane noises and silence, and because of that attention has been paid to the timing and usage of the score.\n\nSteins;Gate has a core set of characters who are surprisingly well defined from the start of the series, but in terms of overall development much of the growth applies only to Okabe. Now this isn't really surprising given the events in the story, and to be honest the show is actually better with his character being the only one who truly changes. Okabe's development when dealing with the events that are rapidly spiralling out of control is handled in a sensitive yet realistic manner, and it's nice to see that the anime hasn't shied away from depicting the apathy he feels after experiencing a series of personally harrowing events.\n\nUnfortunately the attempts to further develop some of the other characters tend to fall a little short of the mark, and this leads to a few situations that effectively remove the dramatic tension that has been painstakingly built up. The sad part is that while it's laudable to try and develop characters like Suzu, Mayuri, Feyris, and even Tennouji Yugo (Mr Braun), this should never come at the detriment of the main storyline.\n\nSteins;Gate is a very entertaining series that isn't afraid to play around with various scientific concepts, but at the same time it clearly avoids tackling certain major issues related to time travel, and the focus on human drama can sometimes be at odds with the events in the storyline. That said, it's a very enjoyable anime that doesn't get too bogged down in technicalities, and while I rather liked the fact that Okabe cast himself in the role of mad scientist (complete with laugh), imagine my surprise at finding out he's supposed to be 18 years old.\n\nWhich brings us back to the ending.\n\nThere's a certain ... \"clinical\" ... feel to the conclusion that really doesn't sit too well, and while it's always nice to see a story end happily, one has to wonder about the plausibility of it all. The thing is, Steins;Gate uses a concept of time travel similar to that used in Quantum Leap, and therein lies the problem. Anyone who is familiar with the latter series knows that Dr Sam Beckett (an actual doctor, not an 18 year old first year student like Okabe), is unable to return to his original timeline because too many changes have been made to past events. In the nomenclature of Steins;Gate, he's moved across too many world lines and affected too many lives, and this is one of the major things that Steins;Gate glosses over completely. Now one could argue that the idea used in the series creates an effective escape clause, but that only covers certain people. The simple fact is that everyone you meet when you travel through time, no matter how brief the contact, is affected by your presence, so in order to return to one's original timeline, one must undo every contact with every person, even down to brushing shoulders with a total stranger on the street.\n\nOne of the other aspects that really should have been explored is Okabe's ability, Reading Steiner. At no point does the series delve into why he has this ability or how it works, and this is more than a little odd given how much importance is placed on \"Fool yourself. Fool the world\".\n\nEven with those issues though, Steins;Gate is easily one of the better science fiction anime to appear in the last few years, and while there are areas that could have been improved upon, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Steins;Gate is an enjoyable romp in the realms of implausibility that delivers on several levels, and while the happy ending may not sit well with everyone, the conclusion to the story does offer a degree of catharsis.\n\nIt's just a shame that everyone seems to think you need a happy ending in order to make a story great.","episodes_watched":24,"scores":{"overall":8,"story":8,"animation":8,"sound":8,"character":8,"enjoyment":8},"entry":{"mal_id":9253,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/9253\/Steins_Gate","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/73199.jpg?s=2085ff5b0da96828fd85131d1a372f59","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/73199t.jpg?s=2085ff5b0da96828fd85131d1a372f59","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/73199l.jpg?s=2085ff5b0da96828fd85131d1a372f59"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/73199.webp?s=2085ff5b0da96828fd85131d1a372f59","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/73199t.webp?s=2085ff5b0da96828fd85131d1a372f59","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/73199l.webp?s=2085ff5b0da96828fd85131d1a372f59"}},"title":"Steins;Gate"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Archaeon","username":"Archaeon","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/19870.jpg?t=1641472200"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/19870.webp?t=1641472200"}}}},{"mal_id":232021,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=232021","type":"anime","votes":2441,"date":"2016-10-18T16:44:00+00:00","review":"This might be one of the worst things I have ever watched. Let's get two things out of the way. Undeniably, this video looks good. It's well drawn, well animated, and is certainly eye catching with its colorful visuals and impressively imaginative landscapes. As music, this is not something that's suited to me, but I can at least understand people who think that Porter's music is palatable to them. My problem with this piece is not related to the audiovisuals but rather with the idea that this should be taken as a story or a music video that is trying to be something more than justPorter's music meshed with beautifully animated sequences. I understand that these criticisms are often held back by the difficulties of critiquing something that isn't overtly concerned with story, but in a piece so unabashedly attempting to draw sympathy, there's fair ground here to levy some serious concerns.\n\nShelter exemplifies everything that is wrong with storytelling in anime, namely that rather attempting to tell a real story developed with content and meaningful emotion, it takes the most abusive shortcut by designing a cute character, throwing her into a position of bittersweet melancholy, and using that as a means of manipulating our basest emotions into believing there is something meaningful and tragic to be said.\n\nPeople are praising the emotional resonance in the story and its ability to bring out the loneliness lost in the profundity of memory. Yet, consider a world where the main character is not a beautiful teenage girl, lost and confused in a world completely foreign to her. When you remove that physical appearance that makes us so inexplicably attracted to her stake in the story, there is ultimately no reason for us to feel sympathy. It is completely superficial. \n\nOne might say that it's only a six minute short, but the fact that Shelter goes out of its way to show for a split second the main character's letter from her father, to invoke the community to spend time and read it on a second watch, tells me that there is a serious intent to manifest some semblance of a meaningful story. However, that is undermined precisely by the video's own neglect of that story. Much like many other anime designed purely for cheap tears and easy pity, we are given not substance, but rather a montage of a young innocent girl cherishing sweet memories with someone we barely meet.\n\nSure it can be cute, but that does not preclude it from being utterly trite. Shelter offends its audience by presenting us with its fascinating visuals, the ostensible undertones of a post-apocalyptic world, the perceived loneliness of being potentially the last human in the universe, but gives us nothing more than the lowest common denominator of a story, one that galvanizes its sympathies out of the most mundane and pathetic tricks in the book, and half-expects us to take it seriously. I cannot in good conscience, recommend this music video to anyone.","episodes_watched":1,"scores":{"overall":1,"story":1,"animation":10,"sound":5,"character":1,"enjoyment":1},"entry":{"mal_id":34240,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/34240\/Shelter_Music","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/82388.jpg?s=1b2bd21d61d9d50022f69f7cc458c625","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/82388t.jpg?s=1b2bd21d61d9d50022f69f7cc458c625","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/82388l.jpg?s=1b2bd21d61d9d50022f69f7cc458c625"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/82388.webp?s=1b2bd21d61d9d50022f69f7cc458c625","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/82388t.webp?s=1b2bd21d61d9d50022f69f7cc458c625","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/82388l.webp?s=1b2bd21d61d9d50022f69f7cc458c625"}},"title":"Shelter (Music)"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Zergneedsfood","username":"Zergneedsfood","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/404977.jpg?t=1644972600"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/404977.webp?t=1644972600"}}}},{"mal_id":969,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=969","type":"anime","votes":2433,"date":"2007-10-01T17:38:00+00:00","review":"Death Note is definitely one of the best anime series of all time, for it presents a deeply unique and compelling story rivaled by few. I can truly say it is one of the best, if not the best anime I've watched. Story: The story is unique. A notebook falls from the sky, and the human who writes a name in it is capable of killing the individual pictured in his mind (I left out the details that you don't care about). This presents the viewers with a highly debatable theme based on morals and justice. Yagami Light, who obtains this power to kill, utilizes itin hopes of creating a utopia in which he is god. Criminals, and only criminals, are to be punished in hopes of a perfect society. Is this however, right? Is it right to kill individuals who have done wrong, and will do wrong again? Can they be reformed? Death Note presents the viewers with questions such as these, questions which cannot be easily answers. This series challenges the viewers morals and for that, it deserves highly. \n\nBut this debatable topic isn't the series strong point. Death Note gets a 10 in the story department, because of the way the plot unravels.  With great and power and ambition, Yagami Light is forced to play a chair gripping game of cat and mouse with those who seek to detain him. The way L attempts to persecute Light is something I have never witnessed in an anime. The first 15 episodes will magically draw you closer and closer to the scene as suspense hangs over their individual methods for identifying the other. You will not be disappointed. \n\nThe flaws begin once it is apparent that there will be a second arc. This to me, seemed like an unnecessary way of drawing out the anime, although arguably a change in situation was required to break the dead lock between Light and L. Anyhow, the series being to lose some of its luster at this point, and if I were to rate both arcs separately, the first would receive a 15\/10 and the second a 9\/10. Anyhow, this intelligent story deserves an overall 10\/10 in my books. \n\nCharacters: Light and L are the most interesting and intellectual characters I've ever seen in an anime. Although both are geniuses, they each possesses that certain something that will make you root for one of them to win the game. Light's charismatic, yet extremely demented character gives you reason to watch his conquests and failures. L's quirky, yet highly intelligent qualities does the same for him. They are both unique and likable in their own ways. Character development is also seen, particularly with Light as you witness his calm, calculating figure being to crack into a maddening and reckless mess. Obsessed and overtaken by his dream of conquest with the Death Note, he changes greatly from the beginning of the series. This change can be seen in various other characters as well, although not as notable. Anyhow, the characters are definitely interesting enough to give this a: 9\/10\n\nSound: Yet another brilliant aspect of Death Note. I truly believe that if not for the soundtrack, the anime would not be where it is. All of those quick decisive moments with lives on the line are made intense, and the calm calculating ones even more so as the characters attempt to read each other. The opera, holy-like music also adds greatly to Light's character and goal of becoming God in his new world. The only flaw here resides in the second opening which at first, may seem disgusting to you. But as you continue to watch the series you will notice just how well it fits Light's demented mind and how everything he has achieved beings to shatter around his feet. 9.5\/10 (rounded to 10)\n\nArt\/Animation: And again, amazingly done. The dark colors suit the anime perfectly, and the characters and scenery are all done amazingly well. I mean, the anime made writing with a pen look cool. The way they made it zoom across that piece of paper ... In terms of animation, the pen wins. It truly does. But seriously, there isn't much action going on here, so there wasn't much to animate. Most of the scenes consisted of the characters talking or thinking, but the scenes there were filled with action (car chase and such) was done very well. A 10\/10\n\nOverall: I was watching the series since it first started coming out, and those weeks of waiting killed me. That was how good this anime was. The suspense was amazing, and it got me thinking. Anyone who finishes this anime will be forced to wonder about what they would have done with a Death Note. Many of them will question and argue about the actions of Light. It is this talkable and complexity that makes the anime shine, in addition to its ability to carve suspense and anticipation into its viewers. I have never seen an anime as good as Death Note, and I highly recommend this anime to be watched. You may hate it (although very few seem to), but it is definitely an anime you must TRY. 10\/10","episodes_watched":37,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":10,"animation":10,"sound":10,"character":9,"enjoyment":10},"entry":{"mal_id":1535,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1535\/Death_Note","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/9\/9453.jpg?s=9acee4c358f62f7c54c6921aabba3842","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/9\/9453t.jpg?s=9acee4c358f62f7c54c6921aabba3842","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/9\/9453l.jpg?s=9acee4c358f62f7c54c6921aabba3842"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/9\/9453.webp?s=9acee4c358f62f7c54c6921aabba3842","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/9\/9453t.webp?s=9acee4c358f62f7c54c6921aabba3842","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/9\/9453l.webp?s=9acee4c358f62f7c54c6921aabba3842"}},"title":"Death Note"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Xyik","username":"Xyik","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/4894.jpg?t=1644792000"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/4894.webp?t=1644792000"}}}},{"mal_id":19816,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=19816","type":"anime","votes":2427,"date":"2009-10-18T14:02:00+00:00","review":"Over the years there have been a multitude of comedy shows that have graced our TV screens, from the surreal stylings of Monty Python and sarcastic wit of Blackadder, to the sci-fi tomfoolery of Red Dwarf and the strange antics of The Fast Show. There are numerous notable series that have taken their rightful places in our DVD collections, and in an age where comedians are treated like rock stars, maybe it's fate that comedy anime would also come of age. It's strange to say this, but humour has never been a strong department for the medium, partly because of the cultural differences between East andWest, but mainly because the majority of anime comedies rely more on parody than anything else. The problem with this is that quite often the viewer is left without a frame of reference, so the humour simply goes over their heads. Some shows manage to get away with it purely by throwing out an almost constant stream of gags in the hope that people will understand enough of them to be entertained, while others like Seto no Hanayome and Jungle wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu have a slightly more careful approach.\n\nThe area where anime is weakest is where situational comedy is concerned. There are plenty of shows around that could invariably class themselves as sit-coms, but the penchant for studios to base their stories in some sort of school setting severely limits the quality of the humour. In essence, the industry's blind adherence to what they think is a winning formula has resulted in the dilution of just about every single joke that could be told in a school setting, so much so in fact that these days studios have fallen to relying on fanservice based comedies in order to make ends meet (pardon the pun).\n\nComedy anime isn't dead though, as there are some rays of light shining down on the wreckage of red noses, bladders on sticks and giant shoes. Nodame Cantabile insane otaku heroine and her long suffering boyfriend introduced many people to the world of classical music and the usage of otaku power when learning French. Genshiken took a slightly rose tinted look at the multi-layered world of the Japanese otaku, while Moyashimon payed homage to the classic American frat comedy National Lampoon's Animal House.\n\nOne series has, however, defied all the conventions, and has become one of the greatest comedy anime of all time. Incorporating elements from some of the best comedy of both East and West, the series has an anarchic streak that, at times, is more reminiscent of Monty Python, The Simpsons and Family Guy.\n\nI am, of course, talking about Gintama.\n\nThe concept of a samurai sit-com isn't new to anime and manga, however it wasn't until the serialisation of Sorachi Hideaki's manga in 2003 that anyone actually realised the potential in this type of story. Set in a quasi-historical Edo, Japan (and possibly the rest of the world), has been conquered by an alien race known as the Amanto. The nation's strongest warriors were no match for the alien technology, and in an effort to prevent another samurai uprising, the powers that be have banned humans from carrying swords in public.\n\nIn this world there lives a former samurai with silver hair who runs the firm known as Yorozuya from his rented second floor apartment. From time to time he takes on odd jobs (yorozuya), for people in order to pay his rent and buy milkshakes and his beloved Weekly Shounen Jump.\n\nHe is Sakata Gintoki, and his destiny is to make you cry with laughter.\n\nTo say that the story is a bit on the haphazard side is probably a gross understatement, however Gintama is nothing if not consistent in its approach. The underlying story is of Gintoki and his \"friends\", Shimura Shinpachi (an average human teenager with no real special qualities), and Kagura (an alien who looks human and possesses monstrous strength), as they go through their days doing odd jobs for people, getting into arguments\/figths with the Shinsengumi (police, kind of), drinking strawberry milkshakes (or some other flavour depending on Gintoki's mood), and trying in some small way to make the world a better place.\n\nAnd that's really about as serious as many of the episodes get. The haphazard approach to the story is a purposeful measure that, strangely enough, works very well, mainly because Gintama is a comedy series. There are story arcs that occur over the course of the show, and even though they may include some serious or dramatic content, Gintama never once loses its sense of fun. Indeed, the comedy is the true strength of this series, not simply in its style and delivery, but also in its content. Many of the visual gags have to be seen to be believed (seriously, how the hell did they get away with the Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon), and whilst the series is top-filled with parodies, the humour is always involving so the viewer rarely feels like a joke has gone over their head.\n\nThat said, Ginatama has one aspect that is greater than all others in terms of its plot and comedy content, and that is its ability to turn the seemingly ordinary into something completely different. This is the main reason why Gintama can be considered a sit-com rather than a parody, as this aspect has more in common with shows like Blackadder and Monty Python than anything else. There are numerous occasions where the series will catch the viewer off guard with its sly, anarchic take on seemingly normal events (like being in a public toilet and running out of paper).\n\nOf course, there are downsides too. Although the series is extremely strong in terms of comedy, it sometimes lacks when events take a serious turn. This may be due to the audience's reactions, as viewers may automatically think that something funny is going to happen next, however a part of it also stems from the fact that the comedy is sometimes too \"strong\". It's ironic to say this, but Gintama's greatest strength may also be its biggest weakness.\n\nAs with any long running shounen series animation and design are pretty good on the whole. The characters convey a sense of visual individuality that at times goes beyond that of other shounen anime, although this is tempered with a small degree of genericism that allows the humour to flourish  . The colours are extremely bold and solid, while the backgrounds and set designs highlight the synergy between alien technology and Edo. The animation itself is of an extremely high standard, so much so in fact that some of the visual gags only really work because of it.\n\nThe high points of the visuals are the show's numerous and well crafted parodies. There are many occasions where the style, animation, end even the character design, changes to make the humour more immediate, sometimes occuring in the blink of an eye, and sometimes lasting for a good portion of a given episode. The series also plays around with a variety of concepts that most people only really read about, one example being an occasion where Gintoki and the gang are rendered invisible because the episode is incomplete. It's nigh on impossible to find another anime that not only mentions something like this, but also shows the viewer what it would look like.\n\nMuch of the humour comes from the characters themselves, but no matter how good the scripting is, delivery is everything when it comes to comedy, and in this respect Gintama is extremely well served by its seiyuu. The cast are able to perform with a panache that is sometimes astonishing, and their portrayals of their respective characters are so good that one would be forgiven for believing they were full time comedians. Possibly the best example of this is Kugimiya Rie (Kagura), who for many years has been typecast into various tsundere roles. Her portrayal of Kagura is truly excellent, especially in terms of comedy, and much like the rest of the cast she manages to not only maintain a consistent character for a an extended period of time, but has actually become more adept with her timing and delivery.\n\nGintama is generally consistent with its choice of music, and certain tracks are repeated throughout the series usually to add to the comic atmosphere of a given scene. That said, some of the more serious moments can feel a little off-kilter as the score changes can sometimes be a little sudden. As with any long running series the OP and ED have changed since the show began airing in 2006. These tracks are usually pretty good at capturing the essence of  Gintama (which just sounds wrong), as a whole, and the opening sequences are designed and choregraphed to highlight the important aspects of the anime - humour, fun, some seriousness, and a large slice of anarchy.\n\nIn all honesty, there is no real reason to find the characters outstanding, and the fact that they are iconic, original and memorable is possibly Gintama's greatest triumph. Gintoki, Shinpachi, Kagura, the members of the Shinsengumi, and all the sundry characters, alien and otherwise, who appear in the show will find some funny bone to tickle. When taken as individuals each is a flawed creation that really wouldn't work were this any other anime, but the plot and scripting for the series, together with the talent of the seiyuu and the design of each character, turns this idea completely on its head. Much of the comedy is dependent on the characters, and it's because the series is so good at entertaining the audience that any noticeable flaws are generally forgiven or ignored.\n\nGintama is not simply a funny anime though. Over the seasons the show has gradually become a phenomenon in the medium, mainly because of its ability to maintain consistent humour for over most of its 201 episodes. The irreverent and oh-so anarchic humour can, at times, come off as weird, but this has only served to endear the series to more viewers.\n\nNumerous fans refer to Gintama as their \"anime crack\", a sentiment which is understandable in a sense as it has the ability to lift one's mood in a way that few other anime can manage. That doesn't mean that everyone will be entertained though, but if the viewer approaches the show with the right sort of mindset (e.g. open), then the series has a lot to offer.\n\nThat said, shounen fans will definitely find Gintama appealing, not simply because it bears all the stereotypical hallmarks of that genre of anime, but also for its ability to creatively parody other shounen tales (like Bleach, Naruto, One Piece, etc - who can forget the infamous DragonBleaPiece movie trailer). Fans of comedy anime like Seto no Hanayome, Jungle wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu and others of that ilk, will also find Gintama's ability to mess with everyday concepts worthwhile.\n\nThere are plenty of aspects to the series that possess a broad appeal in terms of humour, and it's to the credit of everyone involved with the production (from mangaka Sorachi Hideaki on down to the guy\/girl who makes the tea), that the show never gets old, stale, or too bogged down in how good it actually is.\n\nThere's a new king of comedy in town. Make way for Gintama.","episodes_watched":201,"scores":{"overall":9,"story":9,"animation":9,"sound":9,"character":10,"enjoyment":10},"entry":{"mal_id":918,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/918\/Gintama","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/73274.jpg?s=2ed63fe278bf4fc67fab59110b6a83e1","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/73274t.jpg?s=2ed63fe278bf4fc67fab59110b6a83e1","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/73274l.jpg?s=2ed63fe278bf4fc67fab59110b6a83e1"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/73274.webp?s=2ed63fe278bf4fc67fab59110b6a83e1","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/73274t.webp?s=2ed63fe278bf4fc67fab59110b6a83e1","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/73274l.webp?s=2ed63fe278bf4fc67fab59110b6a83e1"}},"title":"Gintama"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Archaeon","username":"Archaeon","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/19870.jpg?t=1641472200"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/19870.webp?t=1641472200"}}}},{"mal_id":318964,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=318964","type":"anime","votes":2385,"date":"2019-10-02T20:19:00+00:00","review":"This movie is just as good as the first two arcs of the show.

Adapted from the manga written by Hiro Mashima of the same name. Now before you continue reading I must warn you that if you haven't seen all the episodes or are a huge fan that can't take criticism please refrain from reading this review. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. For those yet reading this review please keep an open mind about what you are going to read. Initially I did enjoy fairy tail but in the end i started disliking the series. Here are a few reasons why First of all the arcs are short.Which means there's a lot of things they can't do, bigger story, adventure or exploring, showing more of the side characters, etc. Every arc ends up boring to me and not memorable. The arc size also makes it so predictable. They have to go there without knowing much, be beaten by the enemies easily, get back up and run after them, beat them, a little talk afterwards, then go home.\n\nThe fillers, Fairy Tail has horrible fillers. Like the Daphne arc and the Starry Key filler arc. Just unbelievably bad. ABove that the filler arc is the second longest arc in the whole series. For those who might argue that fair tail has \"less\" fillers let me point out that FT has 38 filler episodes out of a total of 175. That's 21% filler, which is quite a lot.\n\nLisanna~They took a nice little cute backstory that helped multiple characters and ruined it. Brought her back without a good explanation and then afterwards nothing has changed. She barely talks to Natsu, she isn't important in the story. It was better when she was gone. Her being back and doing nothing basically ruins the whole flashback which was supposed to show how much she thought of Natsu, he thought of her, how Elfman decided to get stronger after losing her, Mirajane changed to be nicer, etc.\n\nThere's no training neither any foreshadowing. None of them really change. They were only going to train once but then Mashima said screw you, they're going to instead get powered up in 5 minutes. Natsu had a chance to grow with his powers near the beginning. He learned that he could use his flame to hold things or whatever. He forgot right after, lost a good chance and it hasn't showed up again yet.\n\nNatsu's a horrible character. He's a main protagonist of the worst type, cocky yet can't prove it. Always runs ahead and gets beaten easily by the enemies, then he gets up and is able to beat the main boss of the arc. He needs a power up every fight or he loses, he sometimes has to get insulted until he's angry enough to beat him. Why the hell can't they give him a fire lacrima to use in a fight, he always has to get fire from some inconvenient ways. He even forgave Gajeel after he beat Lucy for like an hour, talked to him all nicely about dragons after their fight.\n\nI couldn't even care about any of the characters. They are contrived, one dimensional, stereotypical and lack even the little bit of depth that the story sometime requires.\n\nNatsu's power is supposed to be unique. Yet, every arc they run into a new dragon slayer. And then they run into god slayers that's powers are even stronger than their dragon slayer counterparts. It's like he's making it up as he goes.\n\nThe comedy is annoying. Natsu's vehicle sickness got boring when it screwed up his chance to fight, which was by like the 8th episode. After that it's just been used way too much and has messed with his fighting multiple times since. Gray has to strip every god damn episode, they haven't thought of giving him a jumpsuit or whatever. Everyone elses comedy is boring. The only person who ever says something funny is Happy.\n\nThe action sucked, all the fights weren't interesting and of course were full of random powerups and bad comedy. The animation of the fights were mediocre and most fight end in Natsu consuming fire in some convenient way for the plot or getting help from his \"nakama\" and magically beating the enemy who seemed overpoweringly strong till now.\n\nStory is nothing special. Nothing has really changed since the beginning.\n\nOh the time skip. I totally forgot about mentioning that. It was horrible, a 7 year skip. They didn't even let the mains train or whatever. They came back and were easily able to beat enemies that had almost beaten them 7 years ago and had been training the whole time they were gone.\n\nAll in all Fairy tail happens to be one of the worst battle shounens i have ever seen and this is coming from a guy who has seen a fair amount of shounen.\nWith this I end my rant.\n\nTo those rating this review as \"Helpful\" or \"Not Helpful\" your feedback is greatly appreciated.","episodes_watched":175,"scores":{"overall":2,"story":1,"animation":5,"sound":7,"character":1,"enjoyment":2},"entry":{"mal_id":6702,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/6702\/Fairy_Tail","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/18179.jpg?s=0d4093cd27486f2d1b1e75eb7332e729","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/18179t.jpg?s=0d4093cd27486f2d1b1e75eb7332e729","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/18179l.jpg?s=0d4093cd27486f2d1b1e75eb7332e729"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/18179.webp?s=0d4093cd27486f2d1b1e75eb7332e729","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/18179t.webp?s=0d4093cd27486f2d1b1e75eb7332e729","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/18179l.webp?s=0d4093cd27486f2d1b1e75eb7332e729"}},"title":"Fairy Tail"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Aryaragi","username":"Aryaragi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/2296999.jpg?t=1626504600"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/2296999.webp?t=1626504600"}}}},{"mal_id":267829,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=267829","type":"anime","votes":2344,"date":"2018-01-07T14:29:00+00:00","review":"[Spoiler Warning] I don't understand the hype...What a complete waste of time. They rely so heavily on sex and gore but the story was just absolutely awful. If I could give this series a 0 out of 10 I would. First of all, let's address the English dialogue. Can we stop it? If you can't speak English, just stick with Japanese and subtitle it. The English dialogue was so cringy and unnecessary. Just stop it. They also used Arabic letters to showcase that people from an Arabic origin were discussing the news but the letters meant nothing. It wasn't even a sentence, just letters. Did the creatorsnot have a single Arabic friend to write them one sentence? Maybe even use Google translate?\n\nOk, on with the review.\n\nStory: Extremely weak, rushed, and nonsensical. The questioning of humanity's ability to descend into chaos and violence and whether or not human beings are worth saving at all is not new. It's been done over and over again, which is fine, but at least develop the story. Every decent anime would at least have a decent backstory, some sort of plot to follow, build up, and hopefully reach a climax at some point. This story is ridiculously bad that I found myself yawning throughout the entire thing. \n\nThere is absolutely no consistency, depth, or any cohesiveness to this story. When I finally reached the end of the story, the simplicity in its conclusion was...extremely disappointing. \"God did it\" is not an ending. It's just an excuse to wrap up a story that was haphazardly put together in the first place.\n\nAlso, what's with the constant rapping in the first few episodes? We get it, some kid likes to rap. Congratulations! Can we develop a story now? \n\n0\/10\n\nCharacters: Couldn't care less for any of them. No character development whatsoever and every one of them felt rushed. You know what I learned about the main character? Devilman? He cries. That's his character arc. He cries in the beginning of the series, and then he cries near the end trying to save humanity. Where else could you possibly have known that the main character cries I wonder? It's in the title. They spent more time drawing Miki's crotch and passing the baton back and forth (mostly to herself) than developing any of the main characters.\n\n0\/10\n\nAnimation style: What was the budget for animating this series? Was there even a budget? The fights looked terrible and it looked like all they cared about is how to draw boobs semi-correctly. Speaking of boobs, why did Ryou, a supposedly male protagonist, grow boobs in the end of the series? Is that supposed to mean something? Are we just gonna gloss over the fact that a man grew boobs without explaining anything? I researched this question by the way, and apparently Satan has boobs in the manga. So, logically, when Ryou transforms into Satan, he grew boobs. This is what some people refer to as a masterpiece by the way. \n\n0\/10\n\nWhat an abomination...I'm speechless at how bad it is...and I don't understand how or why anyone would call this a good anime.","episodes_watched":10,"scores":{"overall":1,"story":1,"animation":1,"sound":7,"character":1,"enjoyment":1},"entry":{"mal_id":35120,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/35120\/Devilman__Crybaby","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/2\/89973.jpg?s=1c1a2992342f108c633e1aa58bacb731","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/2\/89973t.jpg?s=1c1a2992342f108c633e1aa58bacb731","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/2\/89973l.jpg?s=1c1a2992342f108c633e1aa58bacb731"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/2\/89973.webp?s=1c1a2992342f108c633e1aa58bacb731","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/2\/89973t.webp?s=1c1a2992342f108c633e1aa58bacb731","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/2\/89973l.webp?s=1c1a2992342f108c633e1aa58bacb731"}},"title":"Devilman: Crybaby"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Aromadi","username":"Aromadi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/6870339.jpg?t=1644887400"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/6870339.webp?t=1644887400"}}}},{"mal_id":150337,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=150337","type":"anime","votes":2337,"date":"2014-07-04T12:54:00+00:00","review":"\"Give people bright colors and fan service and they go crazy and lose any logic\" No game No Life is a curious anime to me. I Consider myself to be a not so cruel scorer always giving anime a chance and always looking for positives but this is not the case for No Game No Life with me. Considered to be the next best thing since canned bread everybody seems to love this and I'm the only one who cant see what is so good about it. I will try to give my vision on the show in the next couple of sections so please barewith me.\n\nStory\n\nThe story without giving away too much its about 2 overly intelligent pair of step brothers Sora and Shiro  who are portrayed as neets. They are bored with normal life and just love to play videogames. One day they get the opportunity to join a game world where 16 races rule. In the game world extreme and weird games exist with rules varying per agreement of the players so everything is at stake. All seems peaches and cream for an interesting anime with some good story movement except that the story progression is really slow.\n\nArt\n\nTo sum it all up its really nice neon colors. Very fluid and detailed animation especially the background. I have to say that despite not enjoying the anime this is its strongest asset and its really pleasing to the eye. Madhouse really did a good job with the art and I think its top 2 of the season along with Bokura Wa mina Kawaisou. \n\nSound \n\nI don't think it was over the top or memorable that you want to buy the OST's or anything. Nothing really negative else to say by my part except that it was solid.\n\nCharacters (Only will be covering 3)\n\na) Sora - Main character, 18 year old neet who lives with his loli stepsister Shiro. Overly intelligent and with many sexual needs (according to the show). Sora quickly became an apparent icon this season for best character this season and all I can say is why? One of Sora's biggest strengths is also his downfall as a character and this is his super intelligence. Nothing is ever a challenge in this supposed challenging game world to him and he always seems to have a plan for everything. He tries to be too cool for my liking. I never found any of his jokes or references to be funny or entertaining only just kinda corny.\n\nb) Shiro - The other main character, 11 year old step sister of Sora. More intelligent than Sora apparently and has a brother complex. With Shiro its another case of overuse of Lolis for roles that can be fulfilled with normal characters along with Black Bullet. I don't get the semi naked scenes of Shiro which in this case is a minor throughout the show and it feels a bit disturbing. Shiro's downfall as a character to me is that she is just there to pull Sora back together and do some crazy deus ex machima to pull him out of the rare stuff that he cant (going according to plan if we follow the show's logic) do. \n\nc) Stephanie Dola - The other main character who's purpose is nothing but be exposed half naked every 4 minutes and be mocked off because of her stupidity. I have gotten slander here on MAL because apparently her role is much deeper in motivating Sora and what not if you go all philosophical with the fan boys. In reality its not and her contribution to the progression of the plot is about 0. \n\nEnjoyment\n\nWhere is the enjoyment supposed to come from this show? If its the games it did a poor job. You never get the sensation that the games are a challenge for any of the main characters because everything goes according to plan and they are never really under any concern due to Sora and Shiro's super Einstein like intellect. There is always something that saves them from defeat or something which gets really annoying by episode 3 or 4. \n\nLet me say that chess game in episode the span of episodes 4-5? (I maybe wrong) Is probably the worst thing you can ever watch since there is absolutely no logic behind it all and its just a complete out of thin air invention to win the game. The only game I really enjoyed where the last 2 episodes because the main characters where actually in a pinch it goes in the most predictable way of having the most useless character in the show do something. It all went according to the same generic running theme throughout the show that everything is going according to the super master plan that we won the game before we even start. How do people get any joy out of this is beyond me. \n\nThe core of the plot is really slow and its pretty much overshadowed by the fan service and stupidity of Stephanie who is pretty much just a guinea pig to try out stuff throughout the show. \n\nOverall \n\nIn the end I was really disappointed since I was looking forward to the show and all I got was just a slap in the face of how overrated, flawed and boring this show is some weeks in. The fan service outshines the plot and that is already a red flag. The plot already weak to begin with and all you get is boobs and stupidity with slow progression its not really ideal.","episodes_watched":12,"scores":{"overall":4,"story":5,"animation":7,"sound":5,"character":4,"enjoyment":4},"entry":{"mal_id":19815,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/19815\/No_Game_No_Life","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1074\/111944.jpg?s=4bd3c7eb9af37f810c37d01d8b792033","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1074\/111944t.jpg?s=4bd3c7eb9af37f810c37d01d8b792033","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1074\/111944l.jpg?s=4bd3c7eb9af37f810c37d01d8b792033"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1074\/111944.webp?s=4bd3c7eb9af37f810c37d01d8b792033","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1074\/111944t.webp?s=4bd3c7eb9af37f810c37d01d8b792033","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1074\/111944l.webp?s=4bd3c7eb9af37f810c37d01d8b792033"}},"title":"No Game No Life"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/javycane","username":"javycane","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/2677035.jpg?t=1513971600"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/2677035.webp?t=1513971600"}}}},{"mal_id":164583,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=164583","type":"anime","votes":2303,"date":"2014-10-12T14:43:00+00:00","review":"Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a brave young boy. He was the best swordsman in the land and the manliest man of all. He overcame countless trials with little effort and won the hearts of many fair maidens. Yes, it's time for Sword Art Online, the origin of many angry rants. The premise doesn't sound too bad. Ten thousand players of a virtual MMO are trapped in the game and forced to complete it to escape, except that death in the game leads to death in real life. Just think about it: this could be a tragic story of strugglewhere death is behind every corner. A story of sacrifice and despair. A story of alliances and betrayal. A story of the struggle to retain humanity in front of impossible conditions. \n\n...But why have any of that when you can have romance and harem?\n\nThat's right; the survival game is just for show. Don't expect deep interpersonal or political conflict. Don't expect psychology or moral dilemmas. Don't expect tactics or mind games. Actually, don't expect witty dialogue of any kind.\n\nAnd that is the biggest problem with this show. It is bankrupt in substance. It's mostly just uninspired romance and harem, with a bit of action here and there. There isn't much thinking involved. A few plot holes I could forgive, but if the show isn't about anything worthwhile, there isn't much to do. What makes this problem all the more apparent is that the premise promises something entirely different than what it delivers. The show has thrown its hands up in the air and said, \"We don't care.\" So why should the viewer? \n\nIt doesn't help that the show has grown infamous for glorifying its protagonist, who in the eyes of many has become the epitome of a Gary Stu. He can defeat anything, he can solve any problem, and he gets all the girls. It's almost like this show was meant to be a propaganda piece in his favor.\n\n\nStory: 3\n\nThe first two episodes are decent, building up the premise. We are introduced to the protagonist Kirito and the concept of the death game. Soon enough, we are told that a month has passed and two thousand players have died offscreen. ...Wait, not even a short montage or anything? Apparently not. Anyway, these two episodes are pretty much the only decent ones, so savor them while you can.\n\nThe third episode begins to show more serious problems. We are supposed to form an emotional bond to new characters in a few minutes, and we have to go through over-the-top angst over irrational actions. But there is also optimism in the air; of course we can revive someone whose brain has been fried, right?\n\nWhat follows is an abrupt leap to harem and romance antics. The next few episodes are about various girls suddenly falling for Kirito, often the same day they met him. This typically involves uncontrollable blushing, fanservice, and people acting Tsundere. You probably get the picture. It doesn't help that many of these episodes have a very filler-esque feel to them. The main plot \u2012 if you can call it such at this point \u2012 takes a backseat in favor of these random new girls. \n\nThe girl called Asuna, who quickly becomes the token love interest for Kirito, has at least met him before, but there is still very little buildup to their relationship. Unless it took place offscreen. You see, another thing that becomes very noticeable is the pacing. There have been timeskips of months between episodes. This wouldn't be a problem if these snapshots contained all the events that were critical to the story, but it's obvious that the author has picked rather boring events out of all the possibilities. Why is it that thousands of people dying is covered in a few lines, while we have to sit through hours and hours of romance and harem? I hate to be beating a dead horse here, but it's unavoidable because it comes up again in just about every episode.\n\nBy now, it has also become obvious to the viewer that Kirito is invincible to the point of tedium. He has a level higher than anyone, the best equipment, and a seemingly endless pool of abilities, but most importantly he always wins. There is sometimes false tension, sure, but you know he will survive anyway. You can only stomach so many clutch survivals before you start rolling your eyes.\n\nThe rest of the story arc involves Kirito and Asuna hanging out in the countryside to spend their honeymoon. They even adopt a daughter to portray a typical happy family. The problem is that their relationship is really not that interesting. But \"dem feels\"! Nah, sorry. I have a heart of stone. \n\nThis is followed by a sudden confrontation with the main villain, which Kirito wins because the power of love conquers all. And by that I mean the power of love conquers the programming of the game. Well, okay, maybe there was some \"power of love\" clause in the code somewhere. It wouldn't surprise me at this point.\n\nPredictably enough, melodrama ensues. Tears, promises of love, etc. You can probably imagine. At least now we're done with this show, right?\n\n\nNo, think again, that was only the good part. There are actually 11 more episodes left, and the journey takes us further downhill. We enter another game, this time without the death aspect. Before we get to the plot itself, even at a glance this idea brings up a few problems.\n\nThe harsh reality hits you faster than you can say \"cashcow.\" This second arc feels completely unnecessary. It has been tied into the original story with an overly convenient plot device for no apparent purpose other than stretching it further. At least know to quit while you're ahead. But no, they just had to drag this show through the mud to rip apart any shred of dignity it had left.\n\nIt doesn't help that there is no death anymore. While this makes the slice-of-life content more fitting, it also removes the established selling point of the show. The change is too abrupt, and the difference in tone is too jarring. If you want to make a slice-of-life of ordinary MMO players, do it from the start. \n\nNow, for the plot itself, and it isn't pretty. We go straight to a Mario game, by which I mean saving a damsel in distress trapped in a cage. And that isn't a metaphor; she is quite literally trapped in a cage. Add tentacles and incest to the plot, and you have a winning combination. The incest aspect is provided by Kirito's sister Suguha, who also provides additional fanservice.\n\nAt least now the pacing is less erratic and there is seemingly less development taking place offscreen. It's just too bad that there is also very little meaningful taking place onscreen. There are some new characters and even an ingame war going on, but it's all so irrelevant to the main story that it's hard to maintain interest. \n\nLong story short, Kirito beats the second villain with the help of more deus ex machinas. There are also more tears, promises of love, etc.\n\nSo now we're done, right? For now, yes, but there's still season 2 to look forward to. \n\n\nSetting:\n\nThis is technically part of the story category, but I really think it deserves its own section here. You see, the very foundations of the setting make no sense. People in Sword Art Online are too often acting like they are in a normal game, not in a life-and-death scenario.\n\nFor instance, why is there so much resentment towards beta testers who have greater knowledge of the game? This isn't a competition; the faster someone beats the game, the faster everyone gets out. And, similarly, why are beta testers reluctant to share information? Are they so worried about other people using their newfound abilities to kill them for no reason? Look, you can't have both a casual slice-of-life of MMO players and a grim death game at the same time. Pick one. \n\nThis casual attitude becomes more pronounced later on when it becomes obvious people are wasting tons of time with unproductive quests, romance, and just hanging around. Kirito himself spends time on seemingly useless sidequests, and Asuna spends time cooking for him. Come to think of it, why has Asuna wasted points on a useless skill like cooking in the first place? Are these people even trying?\n\n\nAnd why are so many players dying when towns are safe zones? Are they stupidly rushing into high-level dungeons? I suppose so. You see, for a grim death game it sure is hard to die in SAO. Bosses won't respawn, so everyone can advance forward, even weak players. Going from town to town is also easy enough with teleport crystals. Well, okay, there is that problem of challenging people to a duel while asleep, but that can't take out so many. \n\nThere is no lack of critical resources because you can hang out in the safety of towns indefinitely. Sure, exp and money are limited because the regeneration of monsters is limited, which is strange game design itself, but they aren't necessary if you stay in town. At least, the show never implies that they are necessary. Oh, and for the record, I'm treating the show as self-contained and ignoring the source material. \n\nSo why do they die? I'd put my money on rushing stupidly into dungeons because we get to see one notable example.\n\nLet's imagine you found yourself in the following situation. Before you and your guild are about to enter a high-level dungeon, you learn that one of them lied about his level. Knowing this, you realize you are underleveled and likely to end up dead, while avoiding death and warning the others would be as simple as staying in town.\n\nWhat would you do? Would you\na) Record a message in advance, knowing that you wouldn't last long, or\nb) Stay in town so that you wouldn't get killed in the first place?\n\nA tricky one, I admit.\n\n\nWe are also introduced to groups of player killers. Sounds good until you realize this isn't a normal game. At least, I thought it wasn't, but it looks like some people didn't get the memo. In a situation like SAO, there should be no reason for these killings. This isn't Danganronpa, where the main point of the premise is that you can only escape by killing someone. This is a game where it makes the most sense to team up and beat the game. There is no prisoner's dilemma; cooperation is the best plan and any sensible person would go for it. \n\nIf you kill someone here, you only get some money and equipment. While it may help you beat the game a little faster, odds are that it will only hurt your chances of survival overall. Just off the top of my head, a few reasons: \n1) If people start killing each other, it obviously increases the risk of dying yourself, both in retaliation and spontaneously.\n2) Killing people reduces manpower needed for beating the game, and the distrust that follows will make it even slower. You could only kill useless low-level players, but they probably don't have much money or good equipment to begin with. \n3) There is the chance that you will land murder charges if you escape from the game and officials find out.\n\nActually, does the equipment even help that much? Kirito seemingly uses the same equipment for long periods of time, yet he is practically invincible. On the other hand, he does say that equipment can be worth many levels, so did he get the best stuff for himself so fast? Is it strange game design or cheat codes? It's anyone's guess.\n\nOf course, if you have little interest in beating the game, killing other players makes more sense, if only a little. I suppose getting more money can help you obtain some luxury items, but is it worth the risk? The implied reason is that they are killing people for laughs, but why did so many murderous psychopaths decide to log into this MMO on its opening day? Is this some kind of stab at gamers, saying that they are unable to distinguish between real violence and fake violence? Maybe, or the author forgot that this isn't a normal MMO. Again.\n\n\nSo is it a legit plan to stay in the virtual world for the rest of your life and give up on getting back to the real world? If so, it would explain a lot. While the range of pastimes in there is smaller than in the real world, maybe there is enough for some people. \n\nThe choice between staying in relative happiness in a virtual world and risking your life returning to the real world could have been an interesting one. Unfortunately, their bodies are deteriorating in real life, which makes the choice very one-sided. For some reason, Asuna has to point this out to Kirito because apparently the state of his real-world body had never occurred to him over the course of two years. Yeah, good job, Kirito, you sure were fast on the uptake. Lying down on the grass and having a carefree nap doesn't sound so smart anymore, eh? \n\n\nFinally, why are virtual MMOs still legal after the SAO incident? Sure, the new hardware is supposedly safer, but the previous death trap must have equally passed through \"strict\" government examination, so who in their right mind would trust them? And even if we assume it is safe, since when has people's hysteria hinged on facts? People fear new technology even when it's harmless, let alone when a massive incident like this happens. There would be mass protests in the streets in favor of banning them.\n\n\nCharacters: 2\n\nYou may have noticed that I have only mentioned three characters by name so far. For some other show, this might be because the cast is so vast that there is no time to go through them all, but here it's rather that there are very few characters worth mentioning. Kirito, and by extension Asuna and Suguha who are defined by Kirito's character, hog practically all of the screentime. \n\nEveryone else gets thrown under the bus. Girls only exist to fall in love with Kirito, and males only exist to be inferior to him. The villains in particular only exist as fodder to the guy.\n\n\nKirito:\n\nI have barely touched on Kirito's personality. Well, blame the show, not me; it should at least be willing to meet me halfway. We know very little about him, other than being invincible and inexplicably good with the ladies. Essentially, he is the manliest man on the planet.\n\nThat's pretty much all he is. Even his dialogue ends up pretty bland. There are no witty insights, no clever jokes, no skillful word games. Much of his dialogue consists of saying that the world is a virtual one, explaining game mechanics, wishing to save everyone, or loving someone forever. The sort of stuff you'd expect from a cardboard cutout hero in a situation like this. \n\nIt can be a facepalm-worthy experience to witness girl after girl falling for Kirito like nothing, often the same day they met him. The show endlessly drills into the viewer that he is the sexiest man alive... for some reason. I get that rescuing people can give you points in their eyes, but come on now. I can only assume there is a hidden manliness stat and his black jacket comes with a +999 boost.\n\nAs far as his invincibility goes, the win streak by itself isn't the biggest problem. The problem is that he always wins through brute strength. That is to say, his character skills and stats. There are no tactics worth mentioning, no psychology, no politics, no thinking whatsoever. He will just go out there and pull off his generic action hero stunts. Sure, developing those skills and stats may have required some tactical thinking. Maybe he has optimized his skill tree or has amazing grinding strats. In theory. We see no hints of it. It all happened offscreen and offscreen doesn't count. I'm sorry, it just doesn't. \n\nTo add insult to injury, some of Kirito's abilities are completely forgotten later on. I'm sure that health recovery thing would have come in handy any number of times. And when even his skills and stats aren't enough, he is saved by plot armor at the last second.\n\nIt's also a mockery of MMOs in the sense that Kirito is able to solo raid bosses. And he is able to attain a level higher than anyone despite playing solo, supposedly because he doesn't have to split the exp. His most unique ability is revealed to be... *drumroll* dual-wielding, which nobody else is allowed to do in this game. This doesn't sound like any MMO I know of, or was the idea to portray a player with god-mode cheats on?\n\nI'm seriously thinking that the show would have been a lot more tolerable if Kirito alone had been replaced by one of the side characters. It still wouldn't have been a masterpiece or anything, but at least the Gary Stu accusations could have been avoided.\n\n\nAsuna:\n\nShe is about as bland in personality as Kirito. She is also portrayed as fairly powerful for no substantial reason but of course nothing compared to him. As time passes, her most notable trait becomes being a textbook Tsundere.\n\n...Well, that was fast. Moving on.\n\n\nSuguha:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, her main role is providing fanservice and a tacked-on incest subplot. It's simply another element thrown into the plot for cheap shock value, if anyone is still shocked by incest in anime nowadays.\n\n\nVillain #1:\n\nThe first villain barely appears, and his motivation for trapping the players is vague, to say the least. He basically did it out of personal interest. He wanted to create a virtual world where death has meaning like in the real one, but as for why he was interested in the idea, he forgot. Err, alright then. Moving on.\n\n\nVillain #2:\n\nThe second villain is pathetic and a disgrace to antagonists everywhere, coming across as a cartoon villain who does evil things for the sake of being evil. The conflict here is portrayed as completely black-and-white, just in case someone had sympathy for the guy, as unlikely as that is. \n\nHis main focus is essentially raping a comatose girl. And that is over obtaining tons of cash, presumably in the millions. If he had left the girl alone, he probably would have got away with it, so for all intents and purposes, he chose raping a girl over millions in cash. Talk about priorities. \n\nCome to think of it, it's already ridiculous that the family of the comatose girl is planning to have her marry the guy. I mean, she is in a coma. As in unconscious, unable to state her own intentions, etc. Where are child protective services when you need them? Thankfully, the law disagrees, so they can't apply for an official marriage. Instead, he'll be adopted by her family as their son in spirit... Wait, what? \n\nFurthermore, his sheer incompetence is mindboggling. He openly explains his evil plans and his security is practically at Dr. Evil level, up to entering a secret keycode in plain sight so that the prisoner can see. Thankfully the government and his company are equally incompetent and are not monitoring his research group closely despite its reliance on infamous technology used in SAO. Are these the same people who deemed the new tech safe? If so, I'd like a second opinion. I wouldn't trust these people to operate Angry Birds, let alone a virtual MMO with potential health risks. \n\n\nArt: 7\n\nSo this is where the money went. The backgrounds look nice but cheap fanservice scenes not so much. \n\n\nSound: 7\n\nNot too bad either. The soundtrack and opening and ending songs work pretty decently, and the voices are also alright.\n\n\nEnjoyment: 5\n\nFunnier than I was expecting but for the wrong reasons. There is something earnest about how the show is trying to portray escapism and human relationships, but it falls just short enough to create a dissonance.\n\n\nOverall: 3\n\nWatch it to witness the writing yourself. But more importantly, by watching the show you can better understand the reviews or, better yet, write one yourself.","episodes_watched":25,"scores":{"overall":2,"story":2,"animation":7,"sound":7,"character":2,"enjoyment":5},"entry":{"mal_id":11757,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/11757\/Sword_Art_Online","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/39717.jpg?s=e418310b575f6afe9ac03b383527169d","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/39717t.jpg?s=e418310b575f6afe9ac03b383527169d","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/39717l.jpg?s=e418310b575f6afe9ac03b383527169d"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/39717.webp?s=e418310b575f6afe9ac03b383527169d","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/39717t.webp?s=e418310b575f6afe9ac03b383527169d","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/39717l.webp?s=e418310b575f6afe9ac03b383527169d"}},"title":"Sword Art Online"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/TheDeedsOfMen","username":"TheDeedsOfMen","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/3807819.jpg?t=1645005600"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/3807819.webp?t=1645005600"}}}},{"mal_id":283193,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=283193","type":"anime","votes":2297,"date":"2018-07-07T07:59:00+00:00","review":"For the better half of my life, I have been looking for an anime series where bunch of kids --who don't know what sexual intercourse is-- fight against tensai super robot power rangers inside settings which has plot for 6 episodes, but still lasts for 24: Filling the remaining air time with b-grade melodramatic past stories, and current time with slice of life soap opera which looks like the anime version of Jersey Shore. For such a specific request to be filled, I had almost lost all hope. Then my boy Trigger arrived to town and not only did this exact thing, but filled theseries with epic symbolism. Basically, whenever anything happens, it is a sexual innuendo about relationships, hugging, kissing and dicks. Really, thanks. \n\nThe actual story centers around our ten kids who are trying to find their soulmate\/significant other\/person with whom they share the best body compatibility with. They do this by piloting mecha in the pairs of two and fighting against these things called Klaxowhatever. Klaxosaur, just like everything and anything else, is a reference. If you remove xo from the name, you get the combination of klasa and ur, klasa standing for \"class\" in polish - and xo obviously meaning hugs and kisses - giving us klaxosaur as: \"U R hugs and kisses class.\" Same thing can be said about the actual title of this series. Darling in the FranXX basically standing for Darling in the Fran hugs hugs. The whole \"two parties fight against each others until one collapses\" is initially just a debate over should you remain loyal to your significant other and are hugs truly enough. The robots think it is not enough, and the whole series is basically our characters realizing the same little by little. This is, indeed, the plot of this series. Pretty cool, huh. \n\nThere are in total of ten main characters here (in case you forgot what you read 17 seconds ago). By 10 main characters, I mean we have 3 actual characters and the remaining 7 are filler people. The characters are just great. Oni girl is basically a whore who is looking for her prince charming. I musn't runway guy does the opposite his name suggests. And the third wheel dude and the most potential prince charming... exists. I call this trio The Cuck Squad, by the way. Rest of the \"characters\" are so much filler I believe the thought process behind creating them was something like: \"Hmmm. we need more people here. Let's see........ One fat guy? Yes, one fat guy coming in.......... girl who wears glasses? ...... Oh yes, f**k yes.\" \n\nThe production is based Trigger. Not exactly as ADHD as Kill la Kill nor a masterpiece from every aspect like Inferno Cop, but at least doesn't ruin the series like they did with Uchuu Patrol Luluko and Ninja Slayer. The OST could use some Tomatodermewhatever they called the band in KlK, and some tedious German language vocals would be great addition to put in the mix, but otherwise I was pleased to get a confirmation that every Trigger anime from now on will be the exact same thing production wise as all the rest have been. \n\nWhen it comes to enjoyment, my expectations were very mixed. I heard so much praise and flaming, and after watching it, I have to conclude that this series can be liked and disliked for infinite different reasons. In one way, the series is a clusterfuck, the seasonal shitstorm, the trainwreck and sum of all wagons. This obviously makes it an obligatory watch for every critic so they can hit it with 1\/10 and call the worst thing ever because once again you can criticize FranXX for thousand and one things. On the other hand, Darling is often so ridiculous that it can offer enormous entertainment value with ironic viewing. All you need is a sense of humor and some chill. The drama, the cute and comfy stuff and the happy moments will serve those are ready to take them for what they are. \n\nAs a final verdict: Critics and the likes can write thousand pages long analysis of all the things that are wrong in this one, people with sense of humor laugh their asses off, and people who approach it with more \"casual\" and open mindset will enjoy this show for what it is. This series has something for each and everyone. If a series like that is not a masterpiece, then I do not know what is. 10\/10.","episodes_watched":24,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":0,"animation":0,"sound":0,"character":0,"enjoyment":0},"entry":{"mal_id":35849,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/35849\/Darling_in_the_FranXX","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1614\/90408.jpg?s=e6ea61a43b8a1dd90101a1a8069f5050","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1614\/90408t.jpg?s=e6ea61a43b8a1dd90101a1a8069f5050","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1614\/90408l.jpg?s=e6ea61a43b8a1dd90101a1a8069f5050"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1614\/90408.webp?s=e6ea61a43b8a1dd90101a1a8069f5050","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1614\/90408t.webp?s=e6ea61a43b8a1dd90101a1a8069f5050","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1614\/90408l.webp?s=e6ea61a43b8a1dd90101a1a8069f5050"}},"title":"Darling in the FranXX"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Karhu","username":"Karhu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/483536.jpg?t=1604776800"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/483536.webp?t=1604776800"}}}},{"mal_id":5048,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=5048","type":"anime","votes":2275,"date":"2008-05-27T18:34:00+00:00","review":"This series is overrated on this site. That is to say, with 110 episodes, your vote only counts after you've seen 22 episodes, almost a full season, and those who don't like this show probably won't wait for 22 episodes to decide. Which is a shame, as it's only after about 20 episodes that this series progresses from something that is slow, somewhat overly bombastic, and hinting at more to come to show itself to be one of the most intelligent pieces of anime that's been made to date. When I say 'intelligent', I don't mean it to be cunning, surprising the viewer with unsuspected plotlines or new angles to view something. Nor does it delve deeply into some obscure theory of science or arts, bombarding the viewer with ideas he couldn't have come up with himself. In fact, there's absolutely nothing in this series that is wholly unexpected or very deep. What it has, though, is a sense of scale that's unsurpassed in any anime - or, for that matter, any television show - I've seen.\nLegend of the Galactic Heroes centers around - you guessed it - a bunch of people who, according to populace at large that inhabits the fictional future this series plays in, are of heroic proportions. That is to say, heroic in a very classical sense, being possibly a negative thing as well as a positive. \nThe series is set in a future wherein the universe known to man is divided into two camps, the aristocratic and absolutist Galactic Empire, and the democratic Free Planets' Alliance, who have been embroiled in a war for some time, seemingly\nbeing evenly matched. This balance is shattered when a military genius with a far-reaching ambition rises on the Imperial side, prompting the Alliance to, somewhat grudgingly, give ever greater backing to the most capable officer on their own side. Both men surround themselves with able staff, who become legends in their own right.\nIt sounds like your average hero of freedom-versus-tyrant story, but it turns out to be anything but. First of all, the heroes do have a sense of their own importance, but also the sense to question whether they are all that special, or whether the circumstances of their times have just brought them to a spotlight which people equal to them could never have aimed at. More importantly, the main question on which the whole series hinges remains an open one. This question is the age-old one of which is better, autocracy or democracy, the problem being that a good autocracy is usually better than a good democracy, but a bad autocracy being worse than a bad democracy. Within the happenings of the show, it becomes apparent that, militarily speaking, at least, a good autocracy has an edge over democracy in terms of speed and decisiveness, and this shows in how the series progresses. \nA large part of the series is devoted to showing the war and its subsequent smaller-scale rumblings. The war is fully shown from the side of the commanding officers - one of only a very few shows to do so - and does show an appropriate sense of scale. With battles involving thousands of battleships and millions of men, simple depictions of large-scale tactics take the place of views of the battlefield itself, and a considerable part of the show is, laudable, devoted to discussions on logistics and military intelligence. \nA larger part still, though, is devoted to discussions on politics, all within the greater autocracy versus democracy question. Again, these thoughts never go very deep, but what strikes one is that so very many possible variables are brought up. Almost any motive of rulers or the general populace that might affect a political decision is included at some point in the show, making me at least think to myself: 'They even thought of th&amp;aacute;t one.' The show does tend, here and there, to lean toward the old 'good soldier, bad politician' clich&amp;eacute;, but, overall, it really lacks a clear villain, instead showing each possible side (apart, perhaps, from religious fanatics) from every possible angle. Moreover, all this is shown within a future universe that is highly consistent over the full 110 episodes, even if differences between the warring sides tend to be somewhat exaggerated: in many cases whole societies seem to act a bit too much according to a somewhat radical ideology, only to make their following actions be true to form.\n\nThis being true to form applies also to most of the actions that, at first glance, seem to be overly dramatical, in the first place many of the actions of the dozen or so main protagonists. However, when thinking about the how and why of their actions, it usually becomes clear that they cannot have but acted as they did, according to cultural mores and individual character. A case in point would be the reliance of many Imperial officers on the character of some military commander to predict his battlefield tactics. This would seem lunacy, until it is remembered that the Imperial commanders are a tight-knit group, mostly of noble birth, and known to each other: each commander would know the peculiarities of all others, which become all the more predictable as the importance of gaining personal glory and honour in battle are taken into the equation. \nThis reliance on known characteristics of all personalities is also possible because the characters don't evolve all that much. Now, I've never understood why 'character progression' in general seems to mean having characters make a full volte-face, and I am, in fact, happy with a series that shows all characters as being fully grown, and fixed in their ways. Each has a specific role to play, and a mind-set that might be predictable, but is, again, true to form. This doesn't make the character shallow. Far from it: their characteristics mean that each takes a single position to a fitting extreme, making for interesting differences between the characters, and accompanying differences in outlook. \nThat said, it is indeed true that the characters may be somewhat flat, and quite a few seem to be included only to show a different point of view toward a specific situation or theory, but it is exactly this relative flatness that makes it possible for them to discuss so many situations.\n\nAs for the art, it is old and outdated, but that can't be held against the show. It is a shame that, mainly in the first season, the series is at times simply bad: persons walk in an awkward way, scenes are recycled, and even relative positions of facial structures change from frame to frame. There's no excuse for that. Technically, though, the art definitely gets better during the course of the show.\nIn fact, the show being old might be a boon. The creators have opted to make the drawing style relatively realistic, which fits the series splendidly. One has only to look at the manga to see how different it could have been: the style of the manga doesn't fit the show at all. \nReal points have to go to the design. Again, nothing is really innovative, from the spaceships to the almost 19th century looking setting to the uniforms of the soldiers. It is, however, solid, and consistent, and really brings the world to life. \n\nThe music is outstanding. It mainly consists of generally well-known classical compositions, which, granted, have been often used before, but never have they been used to such splendid effect: especially the use of pieces during battle sequences, fitting the individual scenes to the music, is a joy to watch.\n\nAs a whole, Legend of the Galactic Heroes never tries to be overly deep, and, though it tends to be somewhat bombastic, never loses itself to any glorification. It is slow and quite meticulous, focusing on a lot of details, and consists for the largest part of dialogue, not action. The story progresses slowly, and only after about a season's worth of episodes the real story starts to evolve. \nAnd this show never, ever tries to evoke an emotional response. The whole series is based on having the viewer have an intellectual understanding of what happens, not an emotional one. There are, thus, no cheap tricks to elicit emotional response, nothing overly dramatic (barring a few strokes of bombast), and no characteristics that make a main protagonist or villain.\nI can only applaud this, considering it a feat to produce such a good series without relying on drama. Legend of the Galactic Heroes is, in this sense, the absolute antithesis of my other personal favourite, Le Portrait de Petit Cossette, appealing to the rational side of the viewer, even when the protagonists act with all their vaunted 'foppery and whim'.","episodes_watched":110,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":10,"animation":8,"sound":10,"character":9,"enjoyment":10},"entry":{"mal_id":820,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/820\/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/13\/13225.jpg?s=04952523581d51757bfcd5fb22347f77","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/13\/13225t.jpg?s=04952523581d51757bfcd5fb22347f77","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/13\/13225l.jpg?s=04952523581d51757bfcd5fb22347f77"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/13\/13225.webp?s=04952523581d51757bfcd5fb22347f77","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/13\/13225t.webp?s=04952523581d51757bfcd5fb22347f77","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/13\/13225l.webp?s=04952523581d51757bfcd5fb22347f77"}},"title":"Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/santetjan","username":"santetjan","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/40245.jpg?t=1370740800"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/40245.webp?t=1370740800"}}}},{"mal_id":27662,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=27662","type":"anime","votes":2231,"date":"2010-06-27T13:38:00+00:00","review":"\"To be blunt, I just enjoy talking to you... so I want to talk with you more.\" \"If our opinions clash, let's talk it over.\" (Dialogue from episode 5) 'Bakemonogatari', cleverly translated as 'Ghostory' or 'Monstory', is about five not-so-normal girls that Araragi Koyomi, a vampire himself, encounters and attempt to save from oddities possessing them. CHARACTER: The main characters of 'Bakemonogatari' are among the most unique and complex I have yet to encounter. Heroine Senjougahara Hitagi is a tsundere like half of all modern heroines in anime, but she is also \u300c\u30c9S\u300d, a sadist to an extreme degree, which is more common for side characters and rare for heroines.Our protagonist, as expected, is rather on the masochist side who takes constant verbal abuse from Senjougahara.\n\nWhat makes the couple extraordinary, is that Senjougahara is often boke while Araragi is tsukkomi. Traditional Japanese stand-up comedy consists of a duo: One takes the \"boke\" role who says something stupid while the \"tsukommi\" role points out the flaws in boke's argument, often with a violent slap in the head.\n\nYes, that's right. Boke is masochist by nature and often not very intelligent, while tsukommi is sadist by nature and often more observant.\nThe leading couple in this series, on the other hand, take turns with the roles. It is particularly interesting when the sadist and intelligent Senjougahara purposefully take on the boke role and overwhelms tsukkomi. Such as making insulting statements that sound flawed, but when Araragi tries to make a comeback, he realizes what she said was true. Or Senjougahara makes a blatantly flawed statement just to hurt Araragi, and his comeback fall into deaf ears. And of course, plenty of intentional boke or tease spoken with so much authority that Araragi just gives up and let it slide.\n\nThe unlikely toggling of comedy roles were delivered extremely well, and this back and forth interaction between the leading couple is a key part of this show's appeal.\n\nThe remaining four main characters are not as complex as the leading couple, but they all have their own unique issues that drive the story,each with distinct personalities that made them memorable.\nThere are 6 main characters in this series, and total of only 5 side\/peripheral characters (Meme, Shinobu, two sisters, and Senjougahara's father) in the whole series. The limited character headcount made thorough character development possible despite being an arc-based series.\n\n\nSTORY:\nSimply put, half the show is about the romantic relationship between the Senjougahara and Araragi.\nThe other half is about a constant argument between two values: The rational vs the idealistic, with Araragi as Mr. Nice Guy seeking happy end for everyone. Solution of supernatural oddities as the topic of the argument.\n\nHachikuji, Kanbaru, and Hanekawa's arcs developed the relationship of leading couple while offering new topics to the story.\nThe only flaw in the story in my opinion, is that Sengoku's arc was pretty much by itself, and contributed very little to the whole series other than loli and moe fan service.\nEach arc is an incident focusing on a different girl, but all the arcs combine to show a whole picture of Araragi and Senjougahara closing their personal distances.\n\n\"Bakemonogatari\" is essentially a verbal performance with visual support. Story is driven by back and forth debate on various issues.\n\n\nSOUND:\nWith verbal performance playing such a big role in this show, voice acting is taken to a whole new level in this series.\nEvery characters' voices fit perfectly, and not only that, distinct tones and nuance of speech establish unique impressions for every single character. The characters speak so fast in this series with lots of tongue twisters, but the seiyuu cast had done a wonderful job in keeping up. I don't think it's an exaggeration to describe voice acting in this series as epic.\n\nMusic score in 'Bakemonogatari' has a generally consistent ambient feel to it with a nice flow. Other than intense music for action scenes, they don't particularly set the mood or enhance drama as what I usually consider to be strong BGM for anime, but the usually upbeat sounds in the background set the quick pace for dialogue, and make conversations all the more engaging.\n\nOP song \"Staple Stable\" is one of the best anime opening theme song by a seiyuu, ever. Really memorable tune accompanied by great vocal and lyric by meg rock was simply amazing.\nThe other four OPs sang by seiyuu of each arc heroines were nowhere as impressive as \"Staple Stable\", but offers refreshment value to the OPs, and fits each character perfectly.\nED song's lyric made little sense at first, but its meaning was unveiled in a conversation between the leading couple in a certain episode, and it turned out to very suitable for the series. The two Senjougahara theme songs (OP1, ED) were masterpieces.\n\n\nART:\nAnimation in 'Bakemonogatari' mainly serve as a visual aid to the verbal performance, and it proved to be very effective.\n\nVisuals for the anime got somewhat of an \"art house film\" treatment. There were many abstract and surreal scenes, unconventional cuts, and intriguing camera angles that made the viewing experience very pleasant. It's the perfected form of SHAFT's signature style.\nCharacter designs were attractive, and main characters had visually shown a wide range of emotion that further portrays the character's state of mind.\n\nThe only complaint I have with the animation is the use of photographs\/videos of real-life imagery. At the risk of sounding like a super-otaku, I would say 3D images do not belong in the world of 2D.\n\n\nENJOYMENT:\nAs a fansubber and having seen thousands of hours of fan\/professionally translated works, I can tell you that at least 10% of the meaning is lost in translation, no matter how well translated. In conversation\/narration driven series filled with wordplay and metaphors, at least 20% of the meaning, therefore enjoyability, will inevitably be lost to non-Japanese speakers.\nStill, 'Bakemonogatari' is a true masterpiece with experimental production that actually worked. Attention was paid to the tiniest details, and a story well-told. Truly amazing direction by Shinbou Akiyuki left us with so many memorable scenes, and this will definitely be a series to be remembered.\n\nThe 8-month wait for the final three episodes were excruciating, but the ending was so satisfying that it almost made it worth the absurd wait. Given the commercial success 'Bakemonogatari' has achieved, I will be hoping for the remaining novels in the series to be animated. Possibly 'Kizumonogatari' OVA\/film and 'Nisemonogatari' as a sequel season.\n\n\nTo be blunt, I just enjoyed listening to them... so I want to listen to them more.","episodes_watched":15,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":9,"animation":9,"sound":10,"character":10,"enjoyment":10},"entry":{"mal_id":5081,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/5081\/Bakemonogatari","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/75274.jpg?s=2699394fc62db8953210b7cd7095c4f9","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/75274t.jpg?s=2699394fc62db8953210b7cd7095c4f9","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/75274l.jpg?s=2699394fc62db8953210b7cd7095c4f9"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/75274.webp?s=2699394fc62db8953210b7cd7095c4f9","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/75274t.webp?s=2699394fc62db8953210b7cd7095c4f9","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/75274l.webp?s=2699394fc62db8953210b7cd7095c4f9"}},"title":"Bakemonogatari"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/8thSin","username":"8thSin","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/321412.jpg?t=1421065800"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/321412.webp?t=1421065800"}}}},{"mal_id":106535,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=106535","type":"anime","votes":2226,"date":"2013-07-23T18:41:00+00:00","review":"What does it take for a series to become a masterpiece? Take a look at Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, and you might find the answer to that question. I'll start this review by pointing out that I was not expecting much from this show. I didn't really want to watch it, either. The Mahou Shoujo genre has never interested me, so when a friend of mine, who in the past suggested things like Mirai Nikki, Deadman Wonderland, Death Note and Psycho-Pass to me, told me to watch Madoka Magica, I thought he was kidding and I ignored the series for a while. Once a month hadpassed, my friend insisted, and I ended up watching the first episode with my sister.\n\nThrowing all my prejucide aside, I sat quietly and watched the first episode. I found it oddly entertaining, so I proceeded to watch the 2nd episode, and then the 3rd. After the 3rd episode ended, I was completely hooked. And by the end of the 12th episode (or the last episode, if you prefer), I was blown away. Gen Urobuchi had done it again.\n\n[Story] \n\u2013  \u201cMake a contract with me, and become a magical girl!\u201d\nThe main character, Kaname Madoka, is a normal 8th grader. Albeit very shy, she is happy, and her family and friends love her exactly the way she is. However, her life takes a dramatic turn when, on a trip to the mall, she rescues Kyuubei, a cat-like being that was being chased by a mysterious black-haired girl. Kyuubei, as a reward, offers Madoka and Sayaka (one of Madoka's friends) a unique deal: he'd make any of their wishes come true, and in exchange,  they would become Magical Girls. And that is how Madoka, and the viewers, are introduced to a world of magic and witches.\n\nNot much else can be said about the story without spoiling anything. However, I have to point that this is NOT your typical Mahou Shoujo, and it's target audience is NOT little girls. Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is a very dark anime, please keep that in mind.\n\nThe way the plot begins to unveil is simply magnificent. The build-up of tension, the plot twists, the drama, the (really heavy) psychological atmosphere-- all contribute to create a story that will keep you on your toes at all times.\n\n[Characters]\n \u2013 \u201cIf someone says it\u2019s wrong to hope, I will tell them that they\u2019re wrong every time. I could tell them that countless times!\u201d\n\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica has a pretty small cast of characters. Because of this, each relevant character grows and changes throughout the series in ways you wouldn't expect. We get to know a lot about the past of some characters, the reasons behind their actions, their feelings, amongst other things, and that makes each character feel unique-- they don't follow any usual patterns.\n\n[Art &amp; Sound]\n  \u2013 \"Is she some kind of anime character or something?\"\n\nAs usual with Shaft (Bakemonogatari, Maria Holic, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei), Madoka Magica has a very original\/weird style of animation. The design of the characters is rather simple and features very light colors. However, the animations are good and fluid, specially during action scenes (more on that in a bit). Buildings, on the other hand, are very futuristic and look pretty cool. The use of glass and fluid decorations makes me think of a very peaceful futuristic world. Nature, on the other hand, doesn't stick out of the norm, but the mixture of green + the futuristic monochromatic buildings is a very neat contrast.\n\nHowever, this wouldn't be one of Shaft's best works if they didn't add their \u201ctouch\u201d.  When Kaname Madoka and her friends enter the realm of the witches, one of the coolest styles of animation I have seen in anime to this day steals the spotlight. It's very hard to explain, since it varies from witch to witch, but it's definitly intriguing. And of course, Shaft's signature: weird cam angles during dramatic scenes. Both of these add to the overall chaotic feel of the series, so I have to applaud their use.\n\nMadoka Magica's opening is \u201cConnect\u201d, by ClariS. Although it's nothing out of this world, I feel that it fits the \u201cMahou Shoujo\u201d theme perfectly. The show has 4 different ending songs, but \u201cMagia\u201d, by Kalafina, is regarded as the \u201creal\u201d ending, since it plays in the most episodes, and denotes the dark nature of the anime. As for the background music, everything fits right into the scenes; whether it's to add intensity to fights or dramatic moments, the music helps and doesn't feel out of place.\n\n[Overall]\n\n \u2013 \u201cWith kindness comes na\u00efvet\u00e9. Courage becomes foolhardiness. And dedication has no reward. If you can't accept any of that, you are not fit to be a magical girl.\u201d\n\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica has got to be the best anime I have ever watched. The way the producers trick the viewers into thinking that this anime is just another Mahou Shoujo is simply brilliant. The characters are interesting, the art managed to catch my attention, and the music is good, but this series' biggest selling point is definitly the plot. Plot twists, drama, heartbreaking AND heartwarming moments... all of these converge into a brilliant plot with a really good ending.\n\nPS: Do not judge a book by its cover!\n\n[Final score: 10\/10]","episodes_watched":12,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":10,"animation":10,"sound":10,"character":10,"enjoyment":10},"entry":{"mal_id":9756,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/9756\/Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka\u2605Magica","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/55225.jpg?s=1219949696611fb4daf9676b888c1110","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/55225t.jpg?s=1219949696611fb4daf9676b888c1110","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/55225l.jpg?s=1219949696611fb4daf9676b888c1110"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/55225.webp?s=1219949696611fb4daf9676b888c1110","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/55225t.webp?s=1219949696611fb4daf9676b888c1110","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/55225l.webp?s=1219949696611fb4daf9676b888c1110"}},"title":"Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Kalypze","username":"Kalypze","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/1575343.jpg?t=1619489400"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/1575343.webp?t=1619489400"}}}},{"mal_id":248570,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=248570","type":"anime","votes":2210,"date":"2017-05-26T10:15:00+00:00","review":"Koe no Katachi is dangerous because it is exploitative. I'm not going to pretend to know anything about deaf people. I don't. This movie certainly does not allow any greater understanding into the mind of deaf people is the point I want to iterate. It uses a serious problem as a plot device constantly and reduces Nishimiya to one-dimension. She is the textbook definition of a mary-sue as well as a damsel in distress. This is clearly troublesome when trying to explain deafness to an able-bodied audience. Nishimiya's entire character is her illness. She is paper thin with her sole character trait being she likesto feed fish. She is so inhuman it is gross. Moe being used in this way is offensive. Including deafness or any other handicap into anime is an exciting idea, and I laud the attempt. Sadly, the execution is simply sickening. A personality-less self-insert male character who wants to repent for mistakes he made when he was a child falls in love with the object of his errs. It's inherently questionable to approach this topic from a romantic perspective because it's hard to sympathize with an object. And that is what Nishimiya is, an object. To be affected on, for us to pity, for us to see illness in a \"new light,\" to justify against bullying, to see the indomitable human spirit. A show like Monster works this concept excellently because it uses the object of interest (Johan) as more of a symbol. This work tries to make Nishimiya a character as deeply developed as Shouya but they foist too many roles on an underdeveloped symbol, not even mentioning her role as a character.\n\nShouya, Ueno, and Ishida are all flat. Their motives are drawn to plot points not to logic. Ueno shows up when things finally start moving in a direction the audience would be satisfied with in tacky KyoAni fashion. Drama in this work is so over-the-top and predictable it's borderline cringe-worthy. Even if you could swallow the unbelievable developments that lead to the saccharine mid-section of the film the way it dissolves is so inauthentic. Shouya shows no signs of development and no effort to change throughout the work and then magically obtains a group of friends.\n\nAs for the abstract? The art? If you polish it up enough and use a voice technique the audience is unfamiliar with you have the safest ticket to visual and audio praise you can muster. Are there creative shots in this work? Impressive blocking of characters? Fresh setting or new takes on animation\/style? No. This is a typical KyoAni work. They stuck with what sells.\n\nWhat the point is thematically I can't tell you. I can tell you that this film is successfully doing what it wanted to do. Capitalize on disease using moe with the highest budget in the industry. This work is not even average, it is bad. Please stop and think about why you feel the way you do when you watch this work. If you're crying is it because Nishimiya is a person you have become endeared by or are you crying because she's like an injured puppy? Affection for things like this a wonderful human trait, but this work is dubious.","episodes_watched":1,"scores":{"overall":3,"story":3,"animation":6,"sound":6,"character":3,"enjoyment":3},"entry":{"mal_id":28851,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/28851\/Koe_no_Katachi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1122\/96435.jpg?s=8ba151c95118a6db1bf1bc364b8e5f3d","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1122\/96435t.jpg?s=8ba151c95118a6db1bf1bc364b8e5f3d","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1122\/96435l.jpg?s=8ba151c95118a6db1bf1bc364b8e5f3d"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1122\/96435.webp?s=8ba151c95118a6db1bf1bc364b8e5f3d","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1122\/96435t.webp?s=8ba151c95118a6db1bf1bc364b8e5f3d","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1122\/96435l.webp?s=8ba151c95118a6db1bf1bc364b8e5f3d"}},"title":"Koe no Katachi"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Detective","username":"Detective","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/207137.jpg?t=1642772400"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/207137.webp?t=1642772400"}}}},{"mal_id":67883,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=67883","type":"anime","votes":2203,"date":"2012-07-27T18:15:00+00:00","review":"There was a time.

A time of captains Harlock, a master time Asia, a time of Domons. Logic was not important. The strategy was not important. If you believe in the impossible, impossible would be nothing in front of you. The time is gone A wave of animes that have to be \"realistic\", \"philosophical\", \"adults\" around us. Are good? Are. Meet your purpose? Meet. However, however ... I miss something. Characters idiots who laugh in the face of death, and notto be shaken by anything. Characters that I remember that, in essence, in the beginning, were not meant to be realistic.\nNo wonder that I am addicted to shonens: manga as One Piece, Fairy Tail remind me that there are heroes who still believe that boundaries are bullshit, and that men should talk about crazy dreams with a smile on his face.\n\nFew original anime (non-manga based) can pass this spirit, and if I had to indicate a Studio to produce an epic-without-notion, \"Gainax\" probably would not be the first on my list.\nBut they did so. Oh, how did.\nLadies and gentlemen, forgiveness for the lengthy introduction: Let's talk of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.\n\nMany have already heard things about this series of 27 episodes. Effusive praise. Discouraging reviews. And you may already have heard the following phrase: \"compliments to the Gurren Lagann are exaggerated\"\nAnd let us be clear: Yes. ARE.\nBut it could not be otherwise.\nGurren Lagann anime is not the type that parses. Is the type of anime to which you manifested with exaggeration and passion. \"Overkill\" is the key word of the anime: everything is extremely Titanic, extreme, \"over-the-top\", \"larger than life\", etc.\n\nWith certain exceptions (some Gundam, some Macross, tss), never been a fan of mecha anime. Would be far from the top of my list and, being this a recurrent genre in every new season animes, I believe my dismay is understandable: it is both anime mecha clamoring arrogantly that will \"revolutionize the genre\", \"overcome Evangelion\", \"be the new Gundam\" and other things that many simply die on the beach, lost in own mediocrity.\nGurren Lagann will by reverse path: doesn't take itself seriously. Does not involve complex plots policies or attempts to \"explore the essence of the human being\". It's about guys inconsequential facing death in colorful fuses (and often ungainly) and BLOWING THINGS UP. Many things.\n\nThe series is a species of \"giant parody mecha\", a spoof so well done that took an undeniable brilliance. As the series develops, over the hump \"70 years\" (frantic action and episodic with colored robots), \"80 years\" (frantic action and sequential with specific enemies ... and colored robots!), \"90 years\" (frantic action with colorful robots ... in space!) and Century 21 (IE ... a tribute to the series, where the hype coming into the extreme).\nThe series features a climate extremely pure (remember One Piece in this sense) that does not match the latest productions of Gainax (with the exception of perhaps Diebuster): in Gurren the Studio tries their best to tell a story extremely positive, bright, boiling the blood-is as an antithesis of Evangelion.\n\n-Characters-\nThe cast features some of the most best ever seen in recent years, with big names like Kamina (\"do not believe in yourself. Believe me, I believe in you \"), Kittan (\" no, this is my soul! You will regret it! \"), Simon (\" my drill is one that PIERCES the HEAVENS! \"), just to name the most unbelievable (after all, we still have Viral Genome, Dayakka-\" My wife is the best of the universe-SWING! \").\nHeroes who face the impossible again and again, like real men. The psychological development of some of them (Simon, to quote) is monstrous: the series managed to combine and traces of human \"weaknesses\" with the \"iconic\" of characters (courage to sacrifice himself when necessary, never retreat, and other elements worthy of legends).\n\n-Style-\nCouncil to watch this anime: turn off your brain. One of the best quotes of the anime is \"Go beyond the impossible and kick the logic to corner\" (Kamina), and this is often taken in a sense more than literal. Gurren Lagann is about ridiculously scenes with epic songs -Sung playing in the background (and I know that many of us love this type of scene, feeling rather lack thereof in the current anime), is about characters screaming attack names aloud, and gigantic explosions. If you allow \"get in the mood\", you will be taken to an unbelievable journey. And smile like a fool, knowing you made the right decision.\n\n-Technical Issues-\n\nThe animation is jaw-dropping. To get an idea, 40% of the money used in the production were dedicated to the last 5 episodes, creating sequences that make many films out there go shame. The soundtrack contributes with the light\/climate: epic songs sung, rap and Opera hybridizes to give a special glow to several of the best scenes of the series (many of these will be marked for those that see).\nPerhaps the only factor of production that is worth being criticized is the episodes \"reprise\" (there are two of them, a long piece of episode 6 and episode 16 integer), but it is worth remembering that this is part of the \"joke\" that Gainax proposed to do, saying that \"kick the logic to corner\" with this series: 27 episodes rather than 26, the protagonist being voiced by a man (many of the previous, as Shinji Ikari of Eva, were dubbed by women), etc.\n\n\"you're praising too! You're exaggerating! \"-\nI 'M. But as I said earlier, this is an anime that does not allow cold and calculating analysis. The very premise, the first episode, it doesn't make much sense. It is a classic \"love or hate\". Or you enter the atmosphere of \"OW MAN, WAY TOO EPICNESS\" or so says \"This is not my type.\" Despite the success that had (yielding promises of future projects), Gurren Lagann is not for everyone.\n\nIt's about courage.\nDramatic sacrifices.\nStruggles that make the DBZ characters seem Wimpy\nIt's about heroic speeches and exaggerated.\nIf you are unable to watch something that cannot lead to seriously, I recommend more sober, more series \"feet-in-the-ground\".\nIf you are willing to embark with the crew of the Gurren-Dan, welcome to war.\nFor freedom.\nBy the human race.\nThrough The Universe.\nTo quote the slogan of a well-known epic film: \"Prepare for glory\".","episodes_watched":27,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":10,"animation":10,"sound":10,"character":10,"enjoyment":10},"entry":{"mal_id":2001,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2001\/Tengen_Toppa_Gurren_Lagann","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/5123.jpg?s=16f4ef0a1609fc3516a381d2f6d79845","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/5123t.jpg?s=16f4ef0a1609fc3516a381d2f6d79845","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/5123l.jpg?s=16f4ef0a1609fc3516a381d2f6d79845"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/5123.webp?s=16f4ef0a1609fc3516a381d2f6d79845","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/5123t.webp?s=16f4ef0a1609fc3516a381d2f6d79845","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/5123l.webp?s=16f4ef0a1609fc3516a381d2f6d79845"}},"title":"Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/FrancAguiar","username":"FrancAguiar","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/1029157.jpg?t=1435600800"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/1029157.webp?t=1435600800"}}}},{"mal_id":222648,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=222648","type":"anime","votes":2187,"date":"2016-07-01T15:05:00+00:00","review":"This review written by me has a reason, because I am myself a 27 year old somewhat failed person.

This proves the concept of the story and how well I could follow it. There were no gaps or plot holes for me to recognize. The art was fitting andthe comedy elements were well placed breather moments making the whole show not too dense and after a bit of drama acceptable. \n\nThe big question is why or when should you watch it?

Bunny Girl Senpai is full of the same issues commonly criticized in most light novel adaptations, so why does it get a free pass? Harem tropes, waifu bait, incest teasing, thin characterization, vague pseudoscience, and an asshole deadpan protagonist who solves a bunch of girls\u2019 problems for them. Most of all, the art and sound are incredibly mediocre excluding the many moments when CloverWorks chooses to bend over and spray shit in our eyes with its abundance of hideous CGI crowds. First and foremost, I hate the writing in Bunny Girl Senpai. Consider the '4' points I rated theshow overall to be a generous acknowledgment of its basic features. It was painful to watch, but not irredeemable. The story follows Sakuta, a second year in high school, as he tries to help girls afflicted by a supernatural phenomenon known as Adolescence Syndrome. If that sounds like a psychological disorder concocted by a pretentious teenage boy trying to sound smart, that\u2019s because it is. If a character suddenly becomes invisible or if everyone is trapped in a three-day long time loop, then the author will call it Adolescence Syndrome and leave the rest up to our imaginations. In other words, it's the author\u2019s way of masking a cheap plot device. Rather than giving us a coherent explanation for the syndrome, the author just handwaves it with common quantum mechanics like Schrodinger's Cat and Laplace's Demon. It\u2019s loosely defined as a supernatural affliction that manifests in people who are going through severe stress, whether it be cyberbullying causing physical cuts, or going invisible because you\u2019re sick of attention. To the show\u2019s credit, as a plot device, it is used to craft some empathetic struggles within the characters and even a little bit of relatability. However, these conflicts aren\u2019t executed nearly as well as they could be. The story is told through five parts, each with a new girl for Sakuta to help and flirt with. This standard harem setup is so unbearable to watch play out because Sakuta is just an awful protagonist.\n\nSakuta is the average deadpan, cynical, uncaring protagonist, except he\u2019s also an unlikable asshole. His one single tone of voice is monotonous boredom, and he almost never wavers from it for the entire series. Keep in mind, this show is FULL of dialogue, but it has no goddamn clue how to make any of it seem interesting. Sakuta\u2019s dialogue isn\u2019t witty or clever like you would expect from a deadpan character, it\u2019s just vulgar, gross, and obnoxious. Deceptively, treats everyone like crap and hides behind irony so that people don\u2019t think he\u2019s that bad of a guy. However, everything he says is actually unironic, there\u2019s no nuance, no punchline, he\u2019s just a bad person. He is never punished for being an asshole, sometimes girls might comment on his behavior if he says something especially inappropriate to them, but right away they move on and act like he\u2019s Jesus-kun again. For example, when a girl says something rude to him he fires back with:\n\n\u201cAre you on your period or something?\u201d\n\nDid a twelve-year-old write this script? Sakuta's shallow quips are always like this, juvenile and crass, and the rest of his dialogue is completely deadpan. He is rarely emotionally impacted by anything; very little makes him impressed or concerned. Viewing a story from the perspective of an uncaring asshole like Sakuta makes it impossible to get invested in anything, or even enjoy it. If the show had actually confronted him about his behavior and acknowledged how bad he was to his friends, then it could have been a character flaw and something to develop upon. But from what we saw adapted, his character development is satisfied with being permanently stagnant. He continues to hide his ugly personality behind a thick layer of snark and quips. Sakuta is just the rotten core of this story, surrounding him is the main attraction, all of the ladies who are strangely drawn to him.\n\nOur first heroine for Sakuta to assist is Mai Sakurajima, the titular bunny girl. Somehow she makes the dialogue even worse, she is equally as dry and cynical as Sakuta. Throughout the series, the script parallels standard rom-com dialogue, except it is written to be as pretentious as possible with the pace cranked down to molasses. Rather than a simple sentence lasting a few seconds, it\u2019s needlessly wrapped into a messy jumble of sophistry and weird unfunny jokes. Why can\u2019t these kids just talk like normal human beings? That would sure as hell make them more engaging to watch, and you know, relatable. Mai is the typical tsundere archetype, with the intruiging bunny girl costume appearing the most in episode one, then rarely appearing for the rest of the series. The whole \u2018Bunny Girl\u2019 hook in the title is contrived for what amounts to little more than big budget clickbait. \n\nThere is one area which Bunny Girl Senpai is deserving of praise, its themes. At least from a conceptual standpoint, they add some nuance and relatability to cast. The execution of these themes, like the rest of the show, leaves much to be desired. Where we see the most intruiging themes on display is in Futaba's arc; she is introduced early in the show as more or less an exposition dumper with the sole purpose of lampshading plot conveniences. The relevant themes of insecurity and social anxiety addressed in her arc are muddled by the terrible hackneyed script. She is a scientist girl for the sole purpose of spouting tropey quantum theory pseudo-science to explain away everything that\u2019s happening. It\u2019s always painfully apparent that the author just read a brief summary about the theories he uses in his story in an attempt to seem intelligent, but it's so clear he didn't bother to fully research them so instead it makes him look stupider. These overlong, cringe-inducing, self-congratulatory \u2018science\u2019 scenes occur almost every episode.\n\nNothing in Bunny Girl Senpai feels real, it's all plastic. Mai and the rest of the girls don\u2019t feel like fully realized characters either. They all experience some kind of turmoil yet this rarely shows through in their personalities. They are all plastic prepackaged moe archetypes, unaffected by anything they go through. Even if a character is visibly changed by their conflict after it\u2019s resolved, it is usually undermined by the show\u2019s terrible writing. For example one girl is affected by Adolescence Syndrome because she is so insecure with her body from how people have treated her, then after her affliction is resolved Sakuta interjects with another one of his crude sex jokes that objectifies her body and undermines everything the arc was building towards. Another issue is the lack of lasting effects to each arc. They are paced too poorly for us to see how characters are impacted, rather than a satisfying conclusion the story just moves on. When the author decides he\u2019s bored of a girl he simply ends the arc, in favor of a new case of Adolescence Syndrome. Of course, with another stock standard girl taken off the shelves at A-1 Pictures\u2019 waifu warehouse to become the show\u2019s new main appeal for a few weeks, until she is inevitably relegated to the supporting cast in favor of a new poster girl.\n\nIt makes the author seem like an impatient teenage boy who just wants to shove as many beautiful girls into the arms of the cool guy bland protagonist. He pairs a girl with the protagonist and lets them flirt a little bit, and before he has to commit and actually develop said girl he gets bored of her. And writing a nuanced character is such hard work for him. So instead he just solves the issue by tossing aside the old girl in favor of a fresh new waifu to fawn all over his self-insert. This is, of course, a fundamental issue of most harem anime, a revolving door of waifus and a self insert protagonist. Being a light novel adaptation, Bunny Girl Senpai bears many structural similarities to a harem anime. Generally this is the reason why I avoid the genre, that and obnoxious fanservice which this series is thankfully frugal with. Eventually, it leaves off on a non-ending because this is an adaptation of an ongoing light novel. The show tries to wrap up the story as neatly as possible at the end of the last girl's arc, but it crashes and burns in its finale. The climax is a filled with overwrought crying, forced drama, and the cheesiest and most cringe-inducing writing in the whole show.\n\nIn a better series, this barren wasteland of a script could be saved by a larger budget, or a more experienced director. However, this show\u2019s decidedly unimaginative directing style leaves much to be desired. The art is mediocre, it\u2019s in no way vivid to look at, the directing fails to make the long stretches of dialogue remotely interesting. Aside from the abhorrent CGI crowds, it isn\u2019t a visual disaster, it could be worse, but it could be so much better. Other dialogue heavy anime like the Monogatari Series utilize unique directing techniques and plenty of visual storytelling to engage the viewer in lengthy conversations between two characters. Strangely, Bunny Girl Senpai desires to be watched as a thoughtful supernatural character drama, but it plays out like a generic light novel romantic comedy, taking the worst aspects of each and failing to craft an original or worthwhile series.\n\n[Final Score: 4\/10]\nSeishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai presents intruiging themes of how people treat and mistreat one another during adolescence. However, it fails to execute its best ideas successfully or in a compelling way due to terrible pacing, narrative structural issues, needlessly convoluted dialogue, mediocre presentation, and a thoroughly unlikable main character. If the author possessed half of the self-awareness he seems to think he has, this may not have been an overrated, cringy, bore-fest.","episodes_watched":13,"scores":{"overall":4,"story":4,"animation":5,"sound":6,"character":3,"enjoyment":2},"entry":{"mal_id":37450,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/37450\/Seishun_Buta_Yarou_wa_Bunny_Girl_Senpai_no_Yume_wo_Minai","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1301\/93586.jpg?s=d1faaee80a36a2bda2a0698c5e57b5f0","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1301\/93586t.jpg?s=d1faaee80a36a2bda2a0698c5e57b5f0","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1301\/93586l.jpg?s=d1faaee80a36a2bda2a0698c5e57b5f0"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1301\/93586.webp?s=d1faaee80a36a2bda2a0698c5e57b5f0","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1301\/93586t.webp?s=d1faaee80a36a2bda2a0698c5e57b5f0","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1301\/93586l.webp?s=d1faaee80a36a2bda2a0698c5e57b5f0"}},"title":"Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/RebelPanda","username":"RebelPanda","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/4150781.jpg?t=1644861600"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/4150781.webp?t=1644861600"}}}},{"mal_id":162769,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=162769","type":"anime","votes":2163,"date":"2014-09-28T14:16:00+00:00","review":"- This Review Contains Spoilers - I'm not entirely sure why I watched all of Mahouka. At some point it was a scholarly interest in why this was the latest hottest thing in light novels. It might have been because people said it gets better in the novels later and I wondered at what stage that would be. At another point it was purely to see if I could finish it as a personal challenge. If I could keep watching I might be able to find something good about this anime. Something that at the end of the day I could say \"sure it was mostlybad, but there was this one thing about the show that was enjoyable\".\n\nI never found that thing. I can find nothing to recommend about Mahouka. It is bad on pretty much every level.\n\nThe first point it fails at, and the main point that drags down the entire show, is the main character. Tatsuya Shiba is a highly talented magician who has been placed in the crappy kids class. He's there because he is bad at pushing a square inch wooden block across a floor with his mind. This is the only thing he is bad at in the world of magic. He is a master magician who can cancel out other magicians magic. He's baffling intelligent to the point that he can calculate mind-bogglingly complex magical problems in milliseconds. In his spare time he's the world's greatest engineer, fronting as the mysterious Silver creating the best magical equipment in the world. He solves magical problems that the rest of the world have been struggling with for years. He creates the power of flight on a whim. He can see through walls. He can take down an entire platoon of terrorists by himself. He can detonate the power equivalent of an atomic bomb over anywhere in the world. He can heal all wounds instantly. He can raise the dead. But he is not very good at pushing a square inch block across a floor so clearly he's a flawed character.\n\nWhen your main character is as perfect as this, there is no tension. There is no struggle. Any problem presented to Tatsuya can be solved with no issue. Yet the show likes to pretend he genuinely has factors against him. It's purely lipservice though that has no practical limitations on his capability to do literally anything. Whenever the show tries to make me feel like Tatsuya is inconvenienced, it ends up flipping around and making me feel like I should be on the side of the people against Tatsuya. It got to the point that for long periods of the show I found it easier to treat Tatsuya like he was the villain.\n\nYou know that big Darwinian speech given by Charles Vi Brittania from Code Geass where he goes on about how the strong will destroy and subjugate the weak and that's why everyone will bow down to Brittania and all hail Brrrrrrrrritannia? That's Tatsuya's, and by extension the author's outlook on life. Except when Charles delivers his speech about the myth of equality, it's by Norio Wakamoto hamming it up to 11 as the most evil character in the world. In Mahouka it's Tatsuya delivering the speech about how equality is a bad thing and we should destroy those who seek to change that, and we're supposed to agree with his outlook.\n\nThe weird thing is, Tatsuya would make a pretty great supervillain. His calm attitude and dangerous intelligence is perfect Bond villain material. He's a cold-blooded killer who wipes out several thousand people without remorse during the show. You can totally do villain as protagonist thing. Light Yagami did a pretty good job of it as a similar smart person with dangerous beliefs and phenomenal power. Tatsuya though is always presented as the hero. All the villains are terrorists, more terrorists, and the Chinese, none of whom are presented as anything other than cardboard cutouts of villains. The first episode shows that the school has a dumb system where less magically talented kids are treated like shit by the upper class of magical students. But instead of coming to the conclusion that the whole system is dumb because it creates a class system, the show comes to the conclusion that the system is bad because it didn't rate Tatsuya highly.\n\nSo we have unstable foundations from which to build this show on, but what about the more superficial presentation angle. Are the magical fights fun? No.\n\nTechnobabble. Magical sequences in the show are interrupted by long explanations of the magical theory behind them. Characters would sit in the cafe and discuss magic. Tatsuya would move a block across a room then launch into a lengthy explanation why this was difficult for him. Tatsuya would explain why wizards flying is really difficult for most of an episode and then proceed to solve it a minute later accompanied by another explanation. I got a pretty good grasp on the world's magic system by the end of the show, but these scenes are all excruciatingly boring even with that knowledge. Eyes glaze over as they talk about oscillating magical frequencies and squiddidly heebijeebies and whatnot. What was even more frustrating is you could use none of this knowledge to enjoy the show more. None of the explanations helped the viewer understanding what was going on in a battle better or let you work out what was going on yourself. Even with the knowledge of magic I gained, it never became useful to know for anything else. It wasn't building lore either since it felt mostly like reading from a highly boring textbook. So what was the point of these lengthy magical explanations?\n\nThe explanation is pretty easy really. You know in Kill la Kill one of the characters would have an explanation as to why Matoi Ryuko gained this incredible power of hers, delving into theories about life fibres and so on, until Mako would burst in and yell \"so what you're saying is Ryuko has awesome powers\", turning the entire previous conversation into a hilarious joke that outlined that none of it was really important? That's Mahouka's magical explanations except it's explaining why Tatsuya is totally awesome. Also it's not played as a joke.\n\nWhat these magical explanations also do is make Mahouka very dull to look at. The vast majority of the show is talking heads with no artistry put into their presentation. The magical fights are equally pretty dull with no interesting fight choreography. In general Mahouka is pretty bland visually and doesn't have great animation either. The music, since I'm on the subject of production values, is also pretty bland. A bunch of generic jpop for OP\/ED and insert songs is the most it can muster. The pacing is also awful, in particular during the middle and boringest arc, and again I can attribute this mostly to these Tatsuya-appealing sessions of lengthy magical explanations that ultimately lead to no conclusion beyond Mako yelling \"so what you're saying is Tatsuya is totally awesome right\".\n\nThere's also a whole load of nitpicky problems. One that bugged me was the show's weirdly conservative treatment of women. Tatsuya's sister is madly in love with him, but oddly that didn't bother me too much because it's just another method the show uses to  appeal to Tatsuya. No what I'm referring to is the weird way anytime a woman would wear something other than the most skin-covering clothing, a character would comment on how they should cover up and stop being such a dirty whore. Usually by Tatsuya, because he's a gentleman *tips fedora*. All while the camera pans lovingly up the underdressed woman's skin and makes their boobs really shiny. It's a small thing, but it compounds with lots of other little things that make me really start to resent the author.\n\nI really tried scraping through my memory banks to find something I liked about the show, but I could come up with nothing. I mostly just found more and more nitpicky problems the further I probed. The character designs are bland to the point that I kept mixing up characters. It has too many characters in general and there were a large chunk of them for whom I didn't understand their purpose. That one episode where the student council leader gave a speech during a debate that solved nothing but somehow their opposition thought they were defeated by this incredibly speech. How boring the presentation of the magical sports were and how bloody long they kept showing them. Perhaps the closest I can think of as a good thing about Mahouka is how, by the end, Tatsuya's power goes beyond the point of even self-parody. So what, one wry smile from the whole show, and even that is an ironic one?\n\nHere's a suggestion for you if you're thinking of watching Mahouka. Puff your cheeks out. Now stick your tongue out slightly. Now blow air out of your mouth so it escapes under your tongue. This should cause your tongue to make a rasping noise, not dissimilar to that of a fart. Congratulations. You have now done something more fun that watching Mahouka with about as much artistic merit.","episodes_watched":26,"scores":{"overall":3,"story":3,"animation":3,"sound":3,"character":3,"enjoyment":3},"entry":{"mal_id":20785,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/20785\/Mahouka_Koukou_no_Rettousei","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/61039.jpg?s=ce9ac825c4747ff93de3cb7ad1b84a38","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/61039t.jpg?s=ce9ac825c4747ff93de3cb7ad1b84a38","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/61039l.jpg?s=ce9ac825c4747ff93de3cb7ad1b84a38"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/61039.webp?s=ce9ac825c4747ff93de3cb7ad1b84a38","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/61039t.webp?s=ce9ac825c4747ff93de3cb7ad1b84a38","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/61039l.webp?s=ce9ac825c4747ff93de3cb7ad1b84a38"}},"title":"Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/5camp","username":"5camp","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/89975.jpg?t=1637511600"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/89975.webp?t=1637511600"}}}},{"mal_id":386639,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=386639","type":"anime","votes":2073,"date":"2021-03-25T10:35:00+00:00","review":"The Promised Neverland 2nd Season is a brilliant achievement of Japanese Television. It is a series that has no reason to exist other than to profit off of unsuspecting fans of the first season. This is the spiritual successor to Tokyo Ghoul: Root A\u2014another anime original sequel that attempted to inflict as much severe pain and suffering on the manga fans as possible. Except, at least that blatant marketing scheme had semi-decent audiovisuals. This sequel follows Female Kirito, previously known as \u201cEmma\u201d. Similar to Kirito, Emma is also the most powerful player in the video game. Rather than using a sword, she has the powerof plot armor to protect her from any danger! Getting chased by a demon? She can outrun it. Armed soldiers can\u2019t kill demons with guns? She\u2019ll kill it with a bow &amp; arrow. Instead of getting followed around by a harem, Female Kirito has a bunch of children that go along with anything she says. They have names but don\u2019t worry\u2014you won\u2019t remember them anyway. Previously a character known as \u201cRay\u201d challenged Emma\u2019s overly idealistic goals. This season he has been renamed to \u201cHay\u201d because has no weight on the plot and allows Emma to do anything\u2014no matter how stupid she acts. A long-lost friend (who was lost for less than 6 episodes) returns, but he\u2019s actually a bitter Bad Guy now! Shocking! But why is he bad? He explains everything to us because we are incapable of comprehending storytelling\u2014we must be fucking idiots! \n\nJust sit back and get spoonfed by one of Season Two\u2019s many iconic exposition scenes: Emma and her harem gather in a non-descript room, and one character stands-up and summarizes 100 chapters of the manga in a five to ten-minute long speech. It\u2019s like karaoke night, but instead of singing, they monotonously read SparkNotes summaries of the manga with no animation whatsoever. Unless you consider a PowerPoint presentation to be animation. The Promised Neverland 2nd Season does not tell a story, nor does it do much of anything. It uses a bunch of unrelated plot points throughout dozens of chapters. Years of time skips pass by in minutes. Then it stitches these barely connected pieces together like a hideous quilt. \n\nThe entire show rides on how Emma\u2019s feeling today. In one episode she\u2019ll let the kids eat potentially poisonous fish, in the other she\u2019ll happily help a demon with its groceries despite knowing they like to eat children for supper. No matter anything she does, she\u2019ll have either a smile on her face or a slightly concerned expression. I don\u2019t like comparing the adaptation to the manga, but in this case, it is impossible to not notice the differences in art detail and writing quality. All of the passion is drained, turning climactic moments into laughably bad dialogue. Villains double-cross each other in unison like a hive mind being controlled by an annoyed writer. \n\nThey should have explained the motivations behind everyone\u2019s sudden changes in goals and morality, but that\u2019d require hard work. And lazy writers don't like doing hard work. Why bother adapting three beloved story arcs from the manga\u2014full of battles that would be VERY expensive to animate\u2014when you can just summarize them with a PowerPoint presentation? That's easy money! Strip away the psychological horror, intelligence, atmosphere, and logic that made the original anime so special, and what do you have left? This piece of inane shit. Granted, I am not a huge fan of the original, but it was light-years better than this. The show is dependent upon the demon creature effects but, even in 2D, they are below average at best. It\u2019s remarkable, really. CloverWorks has mastered the art of being lazy, and they should be applauded for that.\n\nMy instinct is to blame the writers at Cloverworks, but it\u2019s clear from disappearing names in the credits that they did not want to be associated with this colossal dumpster fire. According to interviews, the mangaka co-wrote the anime original story, but that has never stopped a film from being bad. George Lucas co-wrote The Rise of the Skywalker, and George R.R. Martin worked on the clusterfuck that was Game of Thrones S8. Just like those adaptations, The Promised Neverland will go down as one of the greatest declines in writing quality in all of anime history. The last time I saw an anime crash and burn so hard in the final act was Darling in the FranXX. \n\nThat\u2019s all there is to The Promised Neverland 2nd season. Finishing as quickly as possible to cash a paycheck. Every aspect of it is rushed: The stiff voice performances, the recycled soundtrack is poorly mixed. They reuse the same facial expressions, character animations, background art, and CGI monsters. Even to the untrained eye, it will be obvious the production has cut corners in literally every aspect. If you don\u2019t care about quality and want your intelligence to be insulted, watch this remarkable landmark in anime history. Come along, join these personified potatoes on a journey to rebel against Weekly Shounen Jump by becoming the most profitable adaptation while putting in the least amount of talent &amp; budget possible. A journey which they have failed, apparently, according to the abysmal sales.","episodes_watched":11,"scores":{"overall":2,"story":2,"animation":3,"sound":5,"character":1,"enjoyment":2},"entry":{"mal_id":39617,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/39617\/Yakusoku_no_Neverland_2nd_Season","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1815\/110626.jpg?s=5ed0482883c89a0be9c454bec97dac8b","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1815\/110626t.jpg?s=5ed0482883c89a0be9c454bec97dac8b","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1815\/110626l.jpg?s=5ed0482883c89a0be9c454bec97dac8b"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1815\/110626.webp?s=5ed0482883c89a0be9c454bec97dac8b","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1815\/110626t.webp?s=5ed0482883c89a0be9c454bec97dac8b","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1815\/110626l.webp?s=5ed0482883c89a0be9c454bec97dac8b"}},"title":"Yakusoku no Neverland 2nd Season"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/RebelPanda","username":"RebelPanda","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/4150781.jpg?t=1644861600"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/4150781.webp?t=1644861600"}}}},{"mal_id":961,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=961","type":"anime","votes":2065,"date":"2007-09-30T10:22:00+00:00","review":"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS This anime is great, great for one thing which I truly believe is its sole purpose of existence - opening pickle jars. This anime will help you with the opening of jars and various other tasks requiring brute strength. You'll feel like the Hulk after you've watched half the series. And the very reason for all of this is this anime's amazing ability to piss the viewer off like no other series I have ever seen. If you want to be angered, please, please watch this series. Story: Jokes aside, this anime might be considered a decent series to other people, but Iseriously hated it. It started off fine, a few laughs, a somewhat interesting love triangle between Makoto, Katsura and Saionji, resulting in the typical 'idiot girl helps guy she loves to get another girl' thing. ... and hey, although the whole love triangle story wasn't very unique or anything, it entertained... It was fun at first to see this clueless pervert fail at getting a girl. The problem was when it became more of a love hexagon - And things went downhill from there.  The story became predictable and difficult to watch due to the idiotic and retarded main character who must have been the luckiest  sped to walk the earth. The only good thing I can say about this series was the theme it presented to its viewers: to cherish what you have. 1\/10\n\nCharacters: The characters in this anime are seriously some of the dumbest people I have ever seen. Makoto especially - after watching about 5 episodes I wanted to smash his face in. His idiotic expressions, his whiny sped voice, everything about him. I hated it all. I hated the way he looked, the way he talked, and everything he did. My hatred for this character is unparalleled to any other characters I might have ever hated in my life. The only props I can give to the people who dream t up this character was that we got to see him go from a selfish idiot to a selfish asshole by the end of the series.\n\nThat rant out of the way, I don't have much to say bout the other characters which was mainly composed of idiotic girls that for some reason or another couldn't get enough of this whiny faced idiot. The characters in general, didn't have much of a background. We didn't learn much about them or their past, and they just kind of came and went. Again, my only props here is the character development.  1\/10\n\nSound: The opening sounded great, but it didn't really suit the series considering how dark and idiotic it became. The opening was way too happy in contrast to the story. Otherwise, bgm was decent, even good at times. No big comments here: 8\/10\n\nAnimation\/Character Design: I thought the animation and character design was pretty good, one of the series stronger points. All of the character designs although not unique, were nice, and the colors brought out the mood fairly well. The only character design I grew to hate was Makoto's. His round clueless face pissed me off to no end. 8\/10\n\nOverall:\nWhy this is even an anime series? I have no idea. Just turn this damn thing into a hentai or something. Honestly. The main character in this series has sex with pretty much every girl you'll see in this series, for no apparent reason. The girls are just lining up to be with him by the end. The characters are the most idiotic people I have ever seen, and the main character couldn't possibly be fathomed by a normal human being. 4\/10","episodes_watched":12,"scores":{"overall":4,"story":1,"animation":8,"sound":8,"character":1,"enjoyment":6},"entry":{"mal_id":2476,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2476\/School_Days","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/86373.jpg?s=2906152daa138b14f94d7882264f1fc7","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/86373t.jpg?s=2906152daa138b14f94d7882264f1fc7","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/86373l.jpg?s=2906152daa138b14f94d7882264f1fc7"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/86373.webp?s=2906152daa138b14f94d7882264f1fc7","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/86373t.webp?s=2906152daa138b14f94d7882264f1fc7","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/86373l.webp?s=2906152daa138b14f94d7882264f1fc7"}},"title":"School Days"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Xyik","username":"Xyik","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/4894.jpg?t=1644792000"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/4894.webp?t=1644792000"}}}},{"mal_id":145393,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=145393","type":"anime","votes":2041,"date":"2014-06-01T11:53:00+00:00","review":"\u201cNo one knows what the future holds. That\u2019s why its potential is infinite.\u201d Okabe Rintarou (Steins;Gate) Such a powerful quote, from an anime at least just as powerful. It\u2019s one of the many wise quotes featured in the excellent time travelling tale called Steins;Gate. It is a story praised by many, and I think the show is definitely worthy of all its praise: it\u2019s an excellent piece of work. Steins;Gate is, in essence, a unique anime. There\u2019s not a single show that I found to be comparable to Steins;Gate. But why does everyone think of Steins;Gate as such a masterpiece? Story: 10\/10 Steins;Gate is about Okabe Rintarou, a \u201cmad scientist\u201dwho spends his time hanging out in his laboratory with his friends Mayuri and Daru. Ocassionally, they manage to invent futuristic gadgets, though these are never worth mentioning. The first few episodes may turn you down, as it seems like your general slice of life\/comedy anime. However, when their most interesting invention, the Phone Microwave, turns out to be able to send text messages through time, everything changes: the text messages sent to the past have a huge impact on the present. When Okabe, in a horrifying way, finds out about an evil organization called SERN, and their ways, he is forced to use time travelling methods to prevent from getting captured \u2013 and stop their plans. This (around episode 9) is where the amazing Sci-Fi thriller fires up its engines, and puts the viewer on the edge of their seat. What follows is a fascinating (somewhat complex) plot, which manages to blow your mind each episode. Steins;Gate is not just your generic time traveling show; the plot is executed perfectly. Hardly ever before have I encountered such a well thought through plot as featured in Steins;Gate. The show features several jumps in time, but still manages to keep the viewers\u2019 attention without confusing them. The pace present in Steins;Gate is not lacking either \u2013 in fact, from episode 9 onwards the show holds a perfect pace. Piece by piece, the mystery of the events that happen is unveiled, working towards a fantastic, satisfying ending. (Which is very rare, especially for a show with such a complex plot) Story - and plot wise, Steins;Gate is pretty much an unprecedented piece of art, and I think it might stay so for a while.\n\n\nArt: 8\/10\nThis is the field in which Steins;Gate lacks the most. Steins;Gate isn\u2019t a show with a huge budget, and therefore it is to be expected that the art isn\u2019t jaw-dropping. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that the art is bad, or that the drawing style is unbearable. In fact, the goal of the art is to portray the atmosphere as well as possible \u2013 and it does: the art style simply has a way more realistic feel to it than your generic anime.\n\n\nSound: 8\/10\nAmazing voice acting, nice opening, and decent BGM. There were quite some moments where I think there could have been made better use of background music, which is why it misses out on a perfect score here. Nonetheless, very solid sound overall.\n\n\nCharacters: 10\/10\nWhat can I say, the characterization in this one is just fantastic. The characters are written in such a way that you are bound to like them. They all have their own likeable and recognizable traits, which are perfectly described from the start: Makise Kurisu the tsundere, Daru the nerd, Mayuri the childish girl, and so on. I found myself having a weak spot for Kurisu in no time. There\u2019s hardly any character development, but I think this is not necessarily a bad thing; it would only distract from the fantastic plot that is ahead of the viewer. The only character which, logically so, develops, is Okabe: you\u2019ll find him changing in character over the course of episodes, due to the events that unfold. But this is all for the better: this development is, again, done exceptionally well. The development has a very realistic feeling to it (And so do all the characters in general), which makes the story as a whole even more compelling. \n\n\nEnjoyment: 10\/10\nSteins;Gate is one of the few shows that manages to score a 10 on enjoyment for me. Like most people, I found Steins;Gate hard to get into, as the first few episodes don\u2019t really cover much ground. However, once the engine got running, I was hooked. I couldn\u2019t refrain myself from watching episode after episode, slowly crawling to the awesome ending ahead. And I think most people would; as the plot is set up in such a way to keep you hooked each episode. If you are a fan of Sci-Fi, then you will surely enjoy this anime \u2013 but that\u2019s not a necessity. Steins;Gate is an anime that is very likely to keep you hooked. So go ahead, you won't waste your precious time. In fact, you might want to go back in time to watch it again!","episodes_watched":24,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":10,"animation":8,"sound":8,"character":10,"enjoyment":10},"entry":{"mal_id":9253,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/9253\/Steins_Gate","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/73199.jpg?s=2085ff5b0da96828fd85131d1a372f59","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/73199t.jpg?s=2085ff5b0da96828fd85131d1a372f59","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/73199l.jpg?s=2085ff5b0da96828fd85131d1a372f59"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/73199.webp?s=2085ff5b0da96828fd85131d1a372f59","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/73199t.webp?s=2085ff5b0da96828fd85131d1a372f59","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/73199l.webp?s=2085ff5b0da96828fd85131d1a372f59"}},"title":"Steins;Gate"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/NyanPls","username":"NyanPls","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/3704997.jpg?t=1613242800"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/3704997.webp?t=1613242800"}}}},{"mal_id":7406,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=7406","type":"anime","votes":2012,"date":"2008-08-24T05:46:00+00:00","review":"People who know me know that I'm not a fan of episodic anime series unless they're either one season (12-14 episodes) long or a slice of life series. Why? They have a tendency to get boring, or repetitive. But all rules and preferences have exceptions. You know what? Cowboy Bebop is that exception. The story is set in a space western setting - a genre and setting I'm loving more and more for each show I watch that falls under the genre. We follow two bounty hunters, Spike and Jet, who own a ship called the Bebop. They travel the Solar system, chasing wanted criminals toearn money. Along the way, they also pick up two women; the debt-laden Faye Valentine and the playful kid and computer genius Edward (yes, Ed&amp;rsquo;s a girl). \n\nEach episode brings about a new bounty which they chase after, and while that doesn't sound too exciting to watch 26 episodes in a row, you'll end up loving the show. All the different events makes for a certain degree of unpredictability, and you'll sometimes wonder how things will end. However, that alone is not enough to give the story the rating I've given it. So why have I given that rating? Let's continue...\n\nOne of the things that elevate the show a bit above the rest is the manner in which the main cast's pasts are explored. It's not like one flashback episode and you understand everything about how they are today. In one episode you might get one piece, and then the next one in another episode, and it's not until the final three episodes of the show that everything falls in place. This way of executing it makes you want to watch another episode, so that you can find out more about the characters (some may say that this falls in under &amp;quot;Character&amp;quot;, but the manner in which the pasts are explored are more &amp;quot;Story&amp;quot; than &amp;quot;Character&amp;quot;, IMO). Now, that's so far a 9 for the story. Why did it deserve a 10?\n\nThe answer is easy: the way they executed many scenes in the show. The contrasts which you get to see between, music, the setting of scenes and what's really happening just gives the story that extra edge deserving of a perfect score.\n\nThe characters are all really good and interesting fellows. Though they every now and then reminded me of characters from other shows, they preserved that originality which gave a feel that they were, if not completely, then at least a little bit more real than most characters out there. The way their pasts intertwine with the future and how everything ends with them confronting and settling open ends from their pasts is also something that's impressive to watch. I don't really have anything more to say than &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot;.\n\nThe animation is, for a 90s anime, stunningly good. The detail put into backgrounds and surroundings is really good, and I also love how good lighting effects and shading are at times. All of Ed&amp;rsquo;s strange movements are animated really nicely too. If there's something negative, it's the somewhat dull coloring (compared to today's standards), as well as poor effects when traveling in hyperspace.\n\nThe soundtrack is also astounding! The music used for the show is so incredibly varied, and while keeping mostly to the more jazzy tunes, the soundtrack visits so many genres that it's hard to not like at least a few pieces. What I also loved is the way the music was used not only as a medium to go with and amplify the mood, but also as a contrast to what's happening in several scenes. All in all, it's really amazing. Don't have anything to say against voice acting and other sound effects either.\n\nAll in all Cowboy Bebop is an anime that&amp;rsquo;s in the top tier on the greatness scale, and a show I believe every anime fan should give a try.\n\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)","episodes_watched":26,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":10,"animation":9,"sound":10,"character":10,"enjoyment":9},"entry":{"mal_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1\/Cowboy_Bebop","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/19644.jpg?s=42d7666179a2851c99fada2e0ceb5da1","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/19644t.jpg?s=42d7666179a2851c99fada2e0ceb5da1","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/19644l.jpg?s=42d7666179a2851c99fada2e0ceb5da1"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/19644.webp?s=42d7666179a2851c99fada2e0ceb5da1","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/19644t.webp?s=42d7666179a2851c99fada2e0ceb5da1","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/19644l.webp?s=42d7666179a2851c99fada2e0ceb5da1"}},"title":"Cowboy Bebop"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/TheLlama","username":"TheLlama","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/11081.jpg?t=1600353000"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/11081.webp?t=1600353000"}}}},{"mal_id":388496,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=388496","type":"anime","votes":2003,"date":"2021-03-31T08:26:00+00:00","review":"Finally, after all these years, the definitive magnum opus of the Japanese anime industry is here. Eva who? Shingeki no what? Redo of healer is unironically one of the best shows in recent memory. It\u2019s not for everyone, in fact it\u2019s probably not for most people. That\u2019s fine. It was for me. \u201cYou only like Redo because of how edgy it is\u201d Well, you\u2019re not wrong. What makes Kayari so enjoyable is not its story, which is actually pretty good in its own right, but its unique take on the dark fantasy general and how it takes traditional preconceptions of what a MC has to be,and turns them on their head. We have all the same traditional set ups that we\u2019re accustomed to with this genre. JRPG inspired world, OP MC surrounded by a harem of girls, setting out on a quest, etc, ect. Where the series sets itself apart from others is the MCs approach to revenge and life. \n\nIn traditional series like this, you have a MC who is afraid of hurting people, afraid of women and just a beta male in general. What I love about Keyaru is the fact that he just doesn\u2019t give a fuck. He\u2019s not afraid to tear people apart, literally and figuratively, and he reacts how a normal person in his situation would. I love that. What people often forget about when they write negative reviews and talk about the MCs use of rape as a weapon, is the emotional, physical and psychological abuse that he endured at the hands of the people he gets revenge on. Yes, rape is horrible, but in the context of Kayari it is totally understandable from a literary and logical standpoint why its used in the story. \n\nOne negative thing about the anime, is the fact that Keyaru\u2019s desire to not hurt anyone who hasn\u2019t hurt him isn\u2019t emphasised. I think that caused a lot of people to hate him as an MC because of the cut monologues that provide context about his emotional state. While Keyaru is not a good guy in the traditional sense, he is not out to hurt people who have not abused him or hurt his companions. He\u2019s not just out raping and killing people for the sake of it.\n\nOn the animation quality side of things, I think TNK did a better job than I was expecting. The fight scenes are surprisingly well done and the sex scenes are as fluid as you\u2019d hope. I do think the OST was pretty weak, but that\u2019s a rather minor complaint.\n\nA story that makes you uncomfortable is not necessarily a bad story. Sometimes we need to have our views and ideas challenged, and I think Kayari can provide that for fans of dark fantasy anime\/LNs. Again, you know damn well if this show is for you or not. If you\u2019re just gonna have a meltdown about how edgy it is, just stay away. \n\nKayari gets 10 heals out of 10.","episodes_watched":12,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":10,"animation":10,"sound":10,"character":10,"enjoyment":10},"entry":{"mal_id":40750,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/40750\/Kaifuku_Jutsushi_no_Yarinaoshi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1301\/110018.jpg?s=1e33980eb3cbadeb80e6b83df2a5eeca","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1301\/110018t.jpg?s=1e33980eb3cbadeb80e6b83df2a5eeca","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1301\/110018l.jpg?s=1e33980eb3cbadeb80e6b83df2a5eeca"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1301\/110018.webp?s=1e33980eb3cbadeb80e6b83df2a5eeca","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1301\/110018t.webp?s=1e33980eb3cbadeb80e6b83df2a5eeca","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1301\/110018l.webp?s=1e33980eb3cbadeb80e6b83df2a5eeca"}},"title":"Kaifuku Jutsushi no Yarinaoshi"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Marinate1016","username":"Marinate1016","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/7822234.jpg?t=1645006200"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/7822234.webp?t=1645006200"}}}},{"mal_id":7898,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=7898","type":"anime","votes":1997,"date":"2008-09-12T23:42:00+00:00","review":"One Piece is by far the best shounen anime out there that I have watched. But not all share the same views as I do, lets remedy that, shall we? A long time ago, there live a fearsome pirate king who goes by the name of Gold D. Roger. He was able to attain everything. But alas he was captured and sentenced to execution. In the brink of death, he proclaimed that he left the great treasure, One Piece, somewhere in the Grand Line and it is for anyone to claim. This event ignited the Great Pirate Age. In the world of One Piece, there is sucha thing as a Devil Fruit. A devil fruit is a fruit bearing some supernatural ability and whoever devours it will get a unique ability however its origins are unknown. There are three types of Devil Fruit, Paramecia, a fruit that can materialize your body into a property. Zoan, a fruit that gives humans the ability of a certain animal, but if its an animal, it gives the ability of humans. And the last but certainly not the least Logia, is a fruit that makes the consumer manifest a certain element. But of course nothing is perfect. If you eat any of the Devil Fruit, you will be rendered immobilize when submerge in the water.\n\nAnd where is our protagonist? The anime revolves around our mentally impaired boy, Monkey D. Luffy or a.k.a The Straw Hat Pirate(title came from his worn-out straw hat that he always have on). When our boy here ate a devil fruit that turns the consumer's body into rubber, he sets off to find Shanks, his pirate idol to return his straw hat as promise and find One Piece to be able to earn the title of Pirate King. Along the way he gathers all kinds of oddballs for his crew, The Straw Hat Pirates.\n\nNow how exactly is One Piece different from the hundreds of shounen out there. Well, it isnt. It is exactly what a shounen should be. It follows the lose-train-win formula. So how is it any better? Bingo. Because it incorporates the formula into something fresh and simple.\n\nOne Piece arcs can be surprisingly good. There were even times that I was shocked at some plot twists and revelations. It has a very interesting setting as well. And what might that be? The World. The whole world is One Piece's oyster. It varies from vast, scorching deserts to cold snowy mountains, the concept of adventure here is well defined, it really makes you feel that world isnt small after all. And that my friend, is what an adventure anime should really be. \n\nOne Piece knows how to pull it off, be it comedy or serious, and believe me, One Piece knows how to be serious when it needs to be. But it never forgets its roots at the same time, and that is the emphasis of friendship and the bond of Nakama\/Friends that glues the whole crew together.\n\nMost shounen anime's suffers immensely from originality. Because of this, it is hard to distinguish characters from each other, especially in my case as I have my fair share as an otaku. And most of the characters in em lack depth and substance, its hard to remember a character when you know very little about him. But One Piece is immune from this disease. Each character of One Piece is very... say....unique that you'll find it hard to forget about them. They all have their individual motives, strengths, weakness and even quirky traits. Plus, each individual of the Straw Hat Pirate Crew has an immersing past, that'll be hard for you not to get delve into. And they all have a certain role, not one character gets overshadowed by the other. They do meaningful interactions with each other. And regardless, that each member is vastly different from each other, they all formed a formidable bond. Even the by-passing characters are memorable.\n\nIn contrast to the majority, I find the animation to be creative. Just like how the characters are different and distinguishable. Unfortunately people see it as something of a turn off, and quickly judges One Piece as something infantile. I am not going to lie. One Piece will not go beyond the borders of a shounen. It is not mature. But thats not the point here. An anime doesnt need to be ripe to be good. It just needs to be entertaining. Although I do enjoy a deep, thought-provoking anime, an anime doesnt need to be complex to be satisfying. It can be anything, as long as it offers gratification. And One Piece does.\n\nAnother potential problem is its popularity. Most people consider mainstream anime's to be somewhat of a failure because of its targeted demographic, and that is everyone. &amp;quot;If its able to attract toddlers, then it sucks&amp;quot; that seems to be case for most people. Some people neglect any anime that is able to summon countless little children in its area, thus abruptly convicting it as over-rated. Heck, some people even constantly hunts threads, just to be able to crack Narutard jokes off some newcomer. Do not judge One Piece from its fans. Judge it for what it is.\n\nDo not be mistaken, I am not saying One Piece is for everyone. In the end, its all about taste. But if your have any hint of love for shounen surging in your veins, there is no reason for you not to watch this, not one bit.\n\nIn short, the plot is very promising, the main cast is several but well flesh out, the battles are very diverse, and engaging and the comedy doesnt get old, even after 300 episodes. But One Piece is not a masterpiece. It does not break any ground whatsoever. No matter how you see it, its still your typical shounen.\n\nRegardless of this, the level of enjoyment I receive from One Piece is insurmountable. And sometimes thats all you need. Scratch that. Most of the time that's all you need.","episodes_watched":379,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":9,"animation":8,"sound":8,"character":9,"enjoyment":10},"entry":{"mal_id":21,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/21\/One_Piece","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/73245.jpg?s=f3fe2e381fd21074b2bcee020c0fc4bf","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/73245t.jpg?s=f3fe2e381fd21074b2bcee020c0fc4bf","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/73245l.jpg?s=f3fe2e381fd21074b2bcee020c0fc4bf"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/73245.webp?s=f3fe2e381fd21074b2bcee020c0fc4bf","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/73245t.webp?s=f3fe2e381fd21074b2bcee020c0fc4bf","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/73245l.webp?s=f3fe2e381fd21074b2bcee020c0fc4bf"}},"title":"One Piece"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/holdenn","username":"holdenn","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/93647.jpg?t=1222253400"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/93647.webp?t=1222253400"}}}},{"mal_id":114643,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=114643","type":"anime","votes":1948,"date":"2013-09-29T00:39:00+00:00","review":"[Spoiler Warning] There is a scene in Watamote where the main character, Tomoko, experiences what she believes to be public molestation. She panics, unable to even breathe or call for help. The train suddenly stops, and the passengers begin to take their leave. Tomoko then realizes that the object pressing against her is simply a bamboo sword belonging to the girl behind her. After much public embarrassment, she finally breaks free, and moves on to yet another miserable day of her life. To say that Watamote is an uncomfortable anime would be an understatement. Every minute involves Tomoko failing at something in the most awkward wayimaginable, to the point where you can't help but pity the poor girl. It's not even amusing. It's just depressing.\n\nTomoko is a high school girl that simply wants to be liked by her peers. She wants to be seen as attractive by the opposite sex. She is so lonely and socially inept that even hearing a \"goodbye\" from a classmate is seen as a massive success. Her younger brother doesn't care about her problems, her parents think she's a pathetic pervert, and her only friend (who she rarely even sees) is oblivious to Tomoko's blatant emotional issues. She is alone with nobody to help. \n\nDoes she bring some of these problems upon herself? Maybe. Does she try too hard to be somebody that she's not? Definitely. But who can blame her? The only time she had anything even remotely resembling a normal life was when she was a toddler. Of course she's angry. Of course she's fed-up with her lifestyle. \n\nUnlike the source material which presents itself entirely as a gag manga, the anime teases us with signs that Tomoko might actually be changing for the better. But nothing ever does change. She squanders all her opportunities, leaving both her and the audience with a bitter sense of hopelessness. What's the point in enduring so many embarrassing scenes when there is no payoff at the end? Are we meant to be masochists? \n\nThe humor of Watamote is akin to kicking a kitten, and worse - a kitten that you sympathize with. It's a punchline where there is no punchline. The goal is make us laugh at somebody in a pitiable situation, to feel happy that our lives are not quite as bad as Tomoko's. Is that comedy? Is that entertainment? For others, perhaps, but all it did for me was bring back awful memories and remind me of everything wrong with teenagers. Some scenes were so uncomfortable that I had to take a break or avert my eyes for a few moments. That's not what a comedy is supposed to do. \n\nSome of the jokes can be quite funny, though. If you've ever listened to porn or something equally embarrassing on your computer, only to realize that the headphones weren't actually plugged in, well, Watamote will remind you of such times. The best moments are when the humor is restrained and situational. The dialogue between Tomoko and her brother is also well-written and reminiscent of most actual brother-sister relationships; I just wish that there was more of him. \n\nIt's also very easy to relate to Tomoko's situation if you've ever dealt with social anxiety. Sure, her feelings are blatantly exaggerated for comedic effect, but the way people act around her is very much real. Teenagers love to gossip. They love to ignore and exclude anybody that isn't a part of their group. Watamote hits this fact home, reminding us just how idealized high school life is in anime. It is the opposite of escapism. \n\nAs for the art and animation quality, Watamote is an above-average anime. Each scene is made even more depressing by the dark, often blue-and-grey color scheme. The animation is consistent (though there isn't much of it) and, for once, a shut-in character does not look like a supermodel. Tomoko looks disheveled, tired, and unclean. As she should. The animators don't even hold back on making some scenes look utterly repulsive (including a failed experiment with make-up, and a colony of ants making their home in Tomoko's hair... ugh). There's definitely some talent here, and it shows. \n\nThe sound is more of a mixed bag. Kitta Izumi does a fantastic job of voicing Tomoko's character, but the background music is barely noticeable and the opening is some mixture of awful screamo and generic J-Pop. It's a cacophony that I never wanted to sit through more than once (although I'm sure that I'm in the minority). At least the ending sequence sounds more in line with the tone of the series: delightfully disgusting, and cute all the same. \n\nIf nothing else, Watamote should be commended for daring to be different. This is not your ordinary anime. If it was an ordinary anime, Tomoko would be male and she would have a harem in love with her for some inexplicable reason. There is none of that. Watamote wastes no time on romanticizing the high school life, and instead portrays it for what is in reality. Few anime out there have had the courage to do the same.\n\nBut for all the awful, depressing things we see happen to Tomoko, what do we get for it at the end? Nothing but a sad glimpse of a girl desperately clinging to the hope that some day, she might attain a normal person's happiness. A dream that we all know will never be fulfilled.","episodes_watched":12,"scores":{"overall":6,"story":6,"animation":7,"sound":6,"character":7,"enjoyment":4},"entry":{"mal_id":16742,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/16742\/Watashi_ga_Motenai_no_wa_Dou_Kangaetemo_Omaera_ga_Warui","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/51619.jpg?s=d910560bbdfbf09692b1d755dc0f69d0","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/51619t.jpg?s=d910560bbdfbf09692b1d755dc0f69d0","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/51619l.jpg?s=d910560bbdfbf09692b1d755dc0f69d0"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/51619.webp?s=d910560bbdfbf09692b1d755dc0f69d0","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/51619t.webp?s=d910560bbdfbf09692b1d755dc0f69d0","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/51619l.webp?s=d910560bbdfbf09692b1d755dc0f69d0"}},"title":"Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui!"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Veronin","username":"Veronin","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/39613.jpg?t=1644993600"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/39613.webp?t=1644993600"}}}},{"mal_id":236138,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=236138","type":"anime","votes":1936,"date":"2016-12-22T11:15:00+00:00","review":"I write this as a gay adult man who's actually interested in proper M\/M romantic representation and as someone who's jaded of queerbaiting and stereotypical heteronormative gay relationships in the shounen-ai genre. So when I was drawn into the hype that YOI offers a compelling storyline which extends beyond cheap queerbaiting and homo-fanservice, I was intrigued to say the least. I am going to do my best to be entirely unbiased. There are certain redeeming qualities to the show that I think deserves mention. a) Ethnic representation: It isn't often to see America being represented by a Latino, to see prominent cast members from Russia,Thailand, China, Switzerland etc. \nb) Proper treatment of women: Women are not objectified with melon boobs without any form of agency at all. Common anime tropes of the possessive brother veering into romantic desire of his sister are effectively established and subverted accordingly. \nc) Accurate representation of anxiety and its debilitating effects onto one's psyche, projecting insecurity, doubt and unworthiness onto everything around you. \nd) the soundtrack is well composed and suitably appropriate. \ne) effective narrative turn of events in the later episodes that cast light on why certain earlier events transpired the way that they did. \n\nNow, moving on to the problems (SPOILERS INVOLVED):\n\nHorrible ambiguity involved in the main M X M relationship. Frankly, it's disgusting. The relationship between the two characters was never firmly established as fully canon; but there were so many moments between them that comes across as queerbaiting; but never realised as a full-fledged canonical couple that is settled beyond a doubt. The kiss is censored, the rings are dismissed as \"Onajimai you\" (for good luck), and even if we were to believe that they are \"engaged\" at some point, the conversation between Victor and Yuuri at episode 11 and 12 was so formal, as though between a coach and his student, that it just isn't the way a fiance would speak to one another! It vacilliates between intense homo fanservice (\"So Yuuri, what are you going to do to make me excited?\" and outright denial of their relationship, where Yuuri insists that OURRELATIONSHIPISNOTLIKETHAT. It's pretty sad; the show's entire premise is centered on Yuuri finding his sexual maturity and confidence in himself, as well as displaying his \"love\" of Victor to the world, however, there has NEVER been an explicit declaration of love, only outright denials and public displays of affection are either censored such that there is room of ambiguity for what it is, or veering on intense bromance. \n\nTo those people who claim that the ambiguity is what drives the homoerotic tension of the show, I ask you as a gay person. Would you have said the same thing if the couple was a heterosexual couple? You wouldn't, precisely because ALL shojo anime, even if it operates on some level of ambivalence or ambiguity, is always resolved with an outright declaration of romantic intention - it's what makes the scene magical, or romantic. Love is something that should not be hidden, and if this was a shojo show, we would be accusing the creators of playing us for fools. So why are we applying a different standard for YOI? Why is it possible for JJ in episode 11 to declare that he's going to marry his girlfriend, whereas Yuuri and Victor have to hide their relationship, their supposed engagement as \"onajimai\", good luck charms? \n\nSecondly, as a sports anime, it fails on the exact reason that I've mentioned above. Every single sports anime ranging from Free to KnB is all about being CLEAR, CONCISED and DETERMINED on the desire or the goal that you aim to achieve; ie this is what I want, and this is what I plan to do in order to get there. Rather, in YOI it's all about Victor Victor, it's not like that it's not like that. Well then, Yuuri, what exactly is the nature of your relationship? The true nature of their relationship is never fleshed in full, and as a sports anime, the skating scenes were repetitive and unnecessary - is it really needed to cramp 6 skating performances in one episode, of which it pretty much looks the same with bad animation anyways? Plot is almost non existent as well; and seems to exist solely to push for fanservicey elements between the two protagonists. \n\nLastly, the anxiety that Yuuri experiences is becoming a tired, recurring plot device that is losing its effectiveness. in EVERY single relationship conflict, it's always Yuuri who causes the conflict, due to his anxiety such that you can almost distill it down to a formula: Yuuri's anxiety causes some form of misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the situation -&gt; They fight -&gt; Cold War -&gt; They get back together after Yuuri skates. It's never Viktor who begins the fight, speaking of which, we still do not know anything much about who Viktor is as a person; he exists as some cheap 2 dimensional perfect character that is there to lift Yuuri from his anxiety like some Godsend. Asides from the fact that he seems a little clueless on handling Yuuri's anxiety, he doesn't seem to have any flaws as a human being. \n\nLastly, please please please do not every compare this to No.6 where the relationship is explicit, sensitively drawn out, and the characterisation and relationships are honest and sincere, without any cheap queerbaiting at all. Due to its cheap exploitative queerbaiting, which feels deceptive - despite getting \"engagement rings\" in 10, their relationship at 11 and 12 was so horrifying formal, without any of the characteristic warmth of newly engaged - it deserves nothing more than a 5. \n\nAnd for goodness sake, please do not mention that the kiss HAD to be censored due to Japanese media laws. I studied media in Japan at one of Tokyo's top universities. There is no such law involved; Shinsekai Yori and No.6 had explicit M\/M kisses and they were aired on TV you know.","episodes_watched":12,"scores":{"overall":5,"story":5,"animation":5,"sound":9,"character":4,"enjoyment":6},"entry":{"mal_id":32995,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/32995\/Yuri_on_Ice","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/81149.jpg?s=2e525c09497754ab61b4e67aa465ac61","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/81149t.jpg?s=2e525c09497754ab61b4e67aa465ac61","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/81149l.jpg?s=2e525c09497754ab61b4e67aa465ac61"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/81149.webp?s=2e525c09497754ab61b4e67aa465ac61","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/81149t.webp?s=2e525c09497754ab61b4e67aa465ac61","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/81149l.webp?s=2e525c09497754ab61b4e67aa465ac61"}},"title":"Yuri!!! on Ice"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/pearlesscucumber","username":"pearlesscucumber","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/283399.jpg?t=1628592000"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/283399.webp?t=1628592000"}}}},{"mal_id":123595,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=123595","type":"anime","votes":1924,"date":"2013-12-12T16:21:00+00:00","review":"An anime can be critically successful for many reasons, it could be due to a well written and engaging plot, innovative ideas that are perfectly handled or even have a deep plot revolving around thought-provoking themes. More so, \"depth\" has been a cause for the critical success of many anime over the course of time for example \"The Tatami Galaxy\", but for a show to have a level of depth is not an easy task for any writer. However, superficial depth can be achieved easily and even more easily confused for genuine depth. Such superficial depth ranges from cheap shock factor to random philosophical questions\u00a0thathave no relations to the core plot or characters and Elfen Lied is a prime example of such superficial depth.\n\nThe harem genre has never been an interesting or innovative genre in terms of plot and character since the beginning of time. Most harem shows consist of a bland protagonist surrounded by fetish fulfilling bimbos, who are head over heels for the bland protagonist for the most stupid reasons. Pandering, useless fan service, and sometimes being an insult to one's intellect; most harem shows lose all entertainment value to a mature audience. The mass production of such shows led to the belief that \"anime\" is only meant for kids and adolescent teens and have nothing of value to offer for someone more mature. However, this notion surprisingly changed after the release of the infamous, Elfen Lied an original story written by Okamoto Lynn which got a one cour anime adaptation, produced by studio ARMS who are also famous for producing other works like Ikkitousen, a ton of hentai titles and Genshiken.\n\nAt first glance, Elfen Lied is anything but a harem. The show starts with 10 minutes of outright nudity and gore which leaves the viewer in a state of utter shock and terror. These 10 minutes were enough to drive away the weak-hearted. However, after these ten minutes, the story is just a hackneyed amalgamation of cliche, plot devices, plot conveniences, plot holes, and last but not the least some \"smart\" and fetish pandering wrapped up into a harem. Plot conveniences and cliche are in abundance, for example, Lucy, loses her memory (amnesia cliche) when shot with a bullet in the head with a magnum sniper and floats down to a beach. One would expect the military to be present there, anticipating her arrival on several shores as she is indeed a top secret project and above that a threat to the human race, but she conveniently meets up with her one and only friend she ever had, Kouta. The author tries to handle pandering with different tricks such as using \"horns\" for cat ears(Kemenomimi). The whole amnesia cliche is further used as a plot device and conveniently too which involves Lucy, regaining her memories and her other personality whenever the plot asks for it and reverting back to her childlike personality whenever the plot asks for it. As the story progresses the writer cleverly turns what could have been a genuinely mature story about racism and discrimination into a cunning little harem. Every female character introduced is forced upon with some miserable past. It almost seems like the writer is a misogynistic sadist who creates female characters just to torture them. One would expect the writer to use these angst-filled backstories to weave up an emotional tale but fails at doing so as how forced these backstories come off and the overall lack of any development of the character doesn't help either. The story also tries to be dark but only fails as it's an edgy mess due to the abundant amount of unnecessary fan service and the whole over the top nature of the show.\n\nMany claim this certain title, Elfen Lied, to be \"deep\", though I fail to understand why. It touches upon the concepts of racism and discrimination in the most superficial way possible. Lucy and other diclonius were born to kill humans, just like the wolf is born to prey on the sheep. It's in their genes, it's a natural instinct. Now if a man were to cage a wolf and let his sheep roam free, it wouldn't be discrimination, but an act of defense. The same logic is for elfen lied, where most diclonius are caged up and kept in miserable states so that they don't end up wiping out the human race. This is not racisms, neither is this discrimination, it's just simple self defense. This is not depth, this is just ridiculous and superficial handling of a theme that could have been done well.\n\nThe plot progression in Elfen Lied can be only described as utterly stupid. As mentioned before, a \"TOP SECRET PROJECT\" washes through the sea only to land upon some beach where there are no military personnel to take care of such an important event. Then the couple who encounter Lucy, a naked girl with random horns, takes her home, because yeah, when you meet naked a creature with horns, you take her home and give her a nickname as if it were a stray dog, instead of going to the police to report the event. The military sends the worst soldier to find Lucy. Seriously, what kind of a soldier goes ahead and beats up his own comrade when going up against a man killing diclonius. Then the secret military group sends another diclonius to capture Lucy. It is to be noted that Lucy is the queen of diclonius species, and as a queen, she has the ability to order other diclonius to do her bidding. What kind of a \"secret\" organization sends an inferior being of the same species to take out its queen, specially when the queen has the ability to order the other around at her bidding through telekinesis? After this attempt fails they send in another diclonius because, yes, when \"plan A\" fails, you repeat \"plan A\" again. This organization must be run by a bunch of retards. And when one thinks of it, it's even more stupid as the second diclonius has been known for its sheer hate for humanity to the point of killing any human at sight. What kind of a secret organization sends in such a creature to an inhabited area with the ulterior motive of \"saving humans\"? Is this some sort of joke? Kouta later finds out that it was Lucy who had killed his entire family and ends up forgiving her in the blink of an eye. Completely logical.\n\nThe show is comprised of two clear phases. One phase where Lucy regains her memory where the anime becomes edgy and over the top. The other phase is when Lucy is in her amnesia mode where the anime becomes a Harem\/SOL. The writers tried hard to make her cute but she is nothing more than pathetic. Roaming around naked for fanservice to the point where she needs help to even change her panties.The changes between these two phases depend absolutely on the convenience of the plot and we yet don't know when she decides to be a pokemon and when a mindless yandere.\n\nThe characters are the blandest bunch of characters to be ever written and this might not even be an exaggeration. One would expect to have sympathetic feelings towards Lucy due to her tragic past, but everything is so \"plot convenient\" that the tragedies seem fake and lose any impact if possible and come out extremely forced. Other than Lucy, every character is just a bland stereotype. Kouta is your generic harem lead and Yuka is the \"imouto in love with her brother\" archetype. Oh! you thought the bullshit ended with random gore and nudity ? You're wrong, the writers also decide to introduce an incest romance subplot that goes nowhere and just add to the convoluted mess. Other than Lucy and Yuka every other female in the show is a stupid loli as if the \"clever fan service\" wasn't enough already. There's no development to any of the characters. To sum it up all, the characters are just a bunch of retards and lolis who lack development and any core personality.\n\nThe opening sequence is probably the best part of the whole show. With the beautiful soundtrack \"Lilium\" there are some artistic scenes which have no damn relation to the convoluted mess of a plot. The ost is nothing special either and a bunch of them are reused and rehashed constantly but yet fail to be anything memorable. The art and animation is rather average and have nothing special about it. The show lacks aesthetics and any sort of artistic detail. The only details that are probably put in, is during the gore scenes where the disturbing images of the bones of the characters can be seen. The character designs are repetitive to the point where three characters have the same hair color. At least give them some more distinguishable features ffs?\n\nDespite trying to be deep, Elfen Lied fails horribly by only touching on its themes very superficially hence lacking any message at the end of the day. It transforms itself into a generic harem with its seemingly \"clever\" tricks to fool the audience that it's something mature, but at the end of the day, it's just another mindless harem. Also, a useless incest romance subplot that goes nowhere (why is this such a big thing in Japan?) The characters lack personality or development and the art and music is nothing particularly special either. It tries to make up for its flaws with the help of conveniences, cliches, mindless gore and nudity which only worsen the show and makes it \"edgy\" as all hell. This show might appeal to a gore fan, an imouto incest fanatic, a lolicon, a misogynist or a mindless harem lover. Unfortunately, I'm not one of them.","episodes_watched":13,"scores":{"overall":2,"story":1,"animation":4,"sound":4,"character":1,"enjoyment":1},"entry":{"mal_id":226,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/226\/Elfen_Lied","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/6883.jpg?s=55dec3cd95645db7dbd8b99201187aa6","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/6883t.jpg?s=55dec3cd95645db7dbd8b99201187aa6","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/6883l.jpg?s=55dec3cd95645db7dbd8b99201187aa6"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/6883.webp?s=55dec3cd95645db7dbd8b99201187aa6","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/6883t.webp?s=55dec3cd95645db7dbd8b99201187aa6","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/6883l.webp?s=55dec3cd95645db7dbd8b99201187aa6"}},"title":"Elfen Lied"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Aryaragi","username":"Aryaragi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/2296999.jpg?t=1626504600"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/2296999.webp?t=1626504600"}}}},{"mal_id":390656,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=390656","type":"manga","votes":1883,"date":"2021-04-08T08:47:00+00:00","review":"*This review contains spoilers* Ladies and Gentlemen, Hello. My name is Hajime Isayama and today I'll teach you how to write manga. I must begin by saying that you should not be discouraged. At first glance, it can be difficult, but you only have to write 90 chapters perfectly tied together, with great characters and mystery to the world and titans, fantastic fights that actually serve a purpose with barely any talk no jutsu moments, and perhaps the single most important thing in all of this, Sasha being alive. What you ought to do afterward is write a timeskip. This is meant for the end-series so we canhave a \"where are they now\" segment but there is no need to worry about it because another timeskip will occur in the last chapter as we would have the pleasure of seeing in efficiency how terrible Eren's plan was. The first timeskip is primarily meant as a means of showing Eren becoming this evil incarnate that at no point in the series have we gotten hits about such alteration to his character. The second one is instead a quick reminder of how Yams got worse at writing a proper story without contrivance to its characters. Both are meant for Eren as he's convinced that all lives must be taken in order to obtain \"freedom\" and in doing so he ought to go against his friends causing an artificial conflict between him and the rest of Paradis as well countless third parties in which for entirely redundant reasons will join Paradis side and go against Eren. From this point onwards, you don't have to write anything decent since it will all depend on which character is to your liking the most and you'll always have to make him or her achieve whatever goal they are in need of. In this case, it's Armin. He's mastered the talk no Jutsu, I dare to say it's his strongest technique. Anyone he's talked to has been convinced to help him do whatever he's wanted to and its limits know no bounds.\n\nWith the power of friendship, Armin doesn't give up, not for one moment while he and co-venture towards Eren to stop him but first, we must go a bit before all that because you are clearly asking how all those characters have joined the Paradis side. Because of plot device, they ultimately were there because Eren too changed sides and there was no choice but to help their enemies. The two couldn't stay on one side only since that wouldn't make sense, just like it doesn't make any sense for Reiner, Pieck, and others to help Armin and Mikasa, meant solely as an excuse for \"redemption\" for some of the characters. Armin succeeds because of course, he did, Eren becomes dove because of course, he did, we never learn much about the titans and the few things we get to throw at us are pure nonsense in an asspull way upon the \"paths\" was introduced into the story which, for all intents and purposes is the main reason why the second arc of the timeskip is this bad. Historia getting sidelined from the story by getting pregnant off of some random farmer we never know anything about, which it's not the fact the child is not Eren's that pissed me off, but rather that she could've done so much that being someone's whore. To top it all, Eren Lelouch'd his ass out of and acts like he did something important or useful when all he did was fight for something he himself committed. I always knew he was going to do that the moment he becomes evil for the greater good but never wanted to believe it as I knew it wouldn't work with the story itself.\n\nAll the troubles Eren went through, all the people he killed, were just for his friends to live happily ever after. Instead of removing the titan course and finishing what he initially wanted to, he follows the most bullshit route and makes peace for a few generations... slightly for his friends to live their miserable life in complete serenity and with this in mind, the descendants to be inevitably killed. There is no point in taking so many lives when everything remains the same and what Eren has fought so far becomes useless because his goal was suddenly retconned when he confessed his \"love\" to Mikasa all of a sudden. Especially when you murdered 80% of the population and would've taken a mere couple of hours to exterminate the rest and finally be free of the burden. Even if Eren had somehow died because of that, it's still a better outcome of what we've got although it needs to once again be mentioned that what led to that would've been abominable regardless. It can't get out of character than this, and it makes no sense either given how Mikasa got to suck Horse's dick anyway. I wonder what Dove-Eren must've felt when he saw Mikasa getting fucked by the only person he didn't want to fuck her. I bet it's not sitting well with him.\n\n\"Thank you Eren for turning yourself into a mass-murder for our sake\"\n\nIf you want more proof that Armin is the most hateful character, here you go. Eren is the worst character, but Armin is someone you would hate the moment he opens his mouth. When Armin mastered the talk-no-Jutsu it was as clear as day that he was going to succeed in convincing all of the previous enemies into joining his side to take down Eren, which he does, and that he had a plan into making Eren stop but think about it, why would Eren stop and how would Armin make that happen? Apparently, Armin never thought about the consequences, and the whole reason why he did all that in the first place was that it was against genocide, that there had to be a better option to put an end to this and in the last chapter he goes \"Thank you for killing all them fuckers\". What could have possibly happened between his determination to stop Eren and the last chapter that made him accept Eren's behavior and get along with everything he's done? Armin who is not only the brain of the trio, but was always been morally right, and looking back at everything he's always made the right and acceptable decision to put an end to something but in the last chapter he comes across as disingenuous and a piece of shit with virtually no fucking reason that let him to the settlement.\n\nAs for tradition, a good lead female in shonen is hard to come by and Mikasa is no exception. You won't certainly hate her as much as Eren and Armin but will sure get on your nerves with her stoic persona throughout. In the early series, she's got something to work with and her strength was admirable so for all the good reasons she was reliable in that department. I always liked her early on but looking back it's clear Yams either didn't care much about her or perhaps wasn't able to give her more stuff to do as the story went on, which I find extremely odd given how in the post timeskip she was suddenly given more importance than before but ended up being a leftover until the last two chapters gaining the determination to do the thing she should have done a long time ago. Mikasa is a bit awesome in her own way, but she has no ambitions of any kind and comes across as Eren's shadow. It is clear that she has had mental issues since she was a kid from the accident she and Eren had and her affection for Eren is due to this, but Yams does not look into this with the possibility that she may recover one day. Eren seemingly hating her was an excuse to make her grow and act on her own rather than following in his footsteps but she does nothing the entire time besides feeling sad at Eren's sentiments towards her because Yams never gave a shit about her.\n\nI haven't talked about the rest of the characters but really, what there is to talk about? They all suck because the writing sucks and the story shifted from average (Marley) to the worst thing (War for Paradis) in a dozen or so chapters and it destroys everyone's solid characterization they once had. The transition from Eren becoming evil and after meeting Ymir was awful and the premise itself was bad, to begin with, because it didn't build up to characters that would eventually join the Paradis side to defeat a common enemy. It does this by assuming that everyone is fine in the first place, while that couldn't be feasible in any way. Yams wanted to give the characters more depth but clearly couldn't work with the way they were presented in the first place and also goes against their characters as previously they wanted to defeat Eren as quickly as possible without taking out everyone and yet waste time for trivial stuff. A \"goal\" of any of the characters who weren't on Eren's side, vanish because the final moments of the story is them trying to reach and take down Eren and in the midst of all the chaos down there, it's impossible to get any devolvement, and they don't, so Yams had to put Floch as a mini-boss before the final event as a means of showing the \"cooperation\" of the two sides of which couldn't work but the shitty writing proved me otherwise.\n\nWhich is better, the journey or the destination? The answer is both. But can everyone get that luxury? Unfortunately not. What one must do to get near to said luxury? Make the journey be worth the destination. If the AoT story had followed this thought of mine, it would've made sense. What was only needed is a linear thread to follow and find its end without splitting into different directions because you wanted to make it a more compelling approach to your story. You could, but why risk it when you had the answer right in the palm of your hand?\n\nEren died a virgin. That's all you need to know!","chapters_read":141,"scores":{"overall":1,"story":1,"art":7,"character":1,"enjoyment":1},"entry":{"mal_id":23390,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/23390\/Shingeki_no_Kyojin","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/37846.jpg?s=840274d02db453f962e83662b4d7d40e","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/37846t.jpg?s=840274d02db453f962e83662b4d7d40e","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/37846l.jpg?s=840274d02db453f962e83662b4d7d40e"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/37846.webp?s=840274d02db453f962e83662b4d7d40e","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/37846t.webp?s=840274d02db453f962e83662b4d7d40e","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/37846l.webp?s=840274d02db453f962e83662b4d7d40e"}},"title":"Shingeki no Kyojin"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/vetmi","username":"vetmi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/10783406.jpg?t=1640443800"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/10783406.webp?t=1640443800"}}}},{"mal_id":4403,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=4403","type":"manga","votes":1882,"date":"2008-04-29T03:15:00+00:00","review":"Story - 9.38 The first three volumes may discourage some of the readers because it's starts off kind of slow and the initial artwork is not quite up to today's standards. However, after the reader begins the Golden Age arc it is nearly impossible to not be pulled in and become addicted to the series. It is chock-full of action, drama, character development, twists and turns, and just a dash of romance. It defies generalization and is just damn good storytelling. After the Gold Age arc wraps up the story come back full circle to where it left us at the end of volume 3. But bythen the rhythm of the manga has changed completely. The reader has established a deep connection with Guts, Casca, and Griffith and that only grows more as the story continues. You'll be confronted with conflicting emotions and think things like &amp;quot;I really want to see Guts put Griffith in the ground&amp;quot; and at the same time &amp;quot;Griffith is just so damn cool&amp;quot;. These conflicting thoughts and emotions just go to show how invested the reader becomes with the characters.\n\nAnother good thing about the Berserk story is that the protagonist (Guts) is not always the focal character in every chapter. In fact, nearly all of the major supporting cast members receive a considerable amount of page space for their own stories to be fleshed out. Each of these side-stories is not only unique and extremely well developed, but also very deep and revealing as it shows the reader why these character are the way they are. One of the side stories that I found most intriguing was Farnese and Serpico's as it was so beautifully orchestrated as part of the manga as a whole.\n\nThe only problem with the story, in my humble opinion, is the introduction of magic in the manga. I feel that the magic the group &amp;quot;acquires&amp;quot; in volume 24 is somewhat exaggerated and does not suit the dark atmosphere of the story. In fact, at times it can even make some of the chapters feel a bit shounen-esk. But even still, it's pretty much impossible not to enjoy the ongoing story that is Berserk.\n\n\n\nArt - 9.6\n\nThe artwork in the first few volumes of Berserk won't do much to impress many of today's manga readers, but at the time when the series was first serialized (1992) it was certainly well above average. Those initial volumes feature many very unique character designs (especially the apostles) and also sport a relatively high focus on detail. However, where Miura really shows off his latent artistic talents early on is through his ability to create crisp, clear, and highly fluid fight scenes.\n\nOne of the few negative aspects of the early volumes can be identified as the simple shading techniques that Miura used. Also, sometimes the character faces will look just a bit &amp;quot;off&amp;quot; and it can be a little distracting. However, these minor quality issues were most likely due to the time constraints that were in place at the time and not entirely the fault of the artist.\n\nThen as the series progresses the reader gets to watch the artwork literally evolve. As we learn more and more about the characters and the world in which they live, the characters themselves and their environments become more and more visually detailed. The simple shading from the early volumes is eventually replaced by a hand shading technique which gives the series a more gritty and surreal overall feeling. The character designs become more crisp and facial expressions sometimes are so vivid that one look at a character's face is often enough to tell the reader exactly what the character is thinking. By the time the reader makes it into volumes 20 and beyond Miura has made it very clear that he means for Berserk to be truly regarded as a work of art just as much as it is a masterfully epic piece of storytelling.\n\nIn my own experience I have seen very, very few other manga series that can even approach Berserk's later volumes on an artistic level and, unfortunately, I highly doubt that I will ever be able to find its peer.\n\n\n\nCharacters - 9.5\n\nThe very first character you will meet in Berserk is Guts, the &amp;quot;Black Swordsman&amp;quot; with a dark past and a score to settle with his demonic enemies. Certainly not a very revolutionary character at first glance, but even though he may start off as such, his character quickly expands, and ends up as one of the most believable and human characters I have ever witnessed.\n\nAs the story unwinds, you follow Guts through his past, allowing you to experience his personality change during his constant battle against fate. You follow Guts through waves of despair and hardships offset only by the flickering fires of friendship and trust. Eventually, Guts becomes like a maelstrom of opposing emotions, and the question arises, will he continue on his path of all-consuming revenge even if it means losing everything he has come to care for?\n\nThe other characters that appear throughout the course of the story come in all different shapes and sizes and all play their roles perfectly, just as support characters should. The more important support characters, protagonists and antagonists alike, are all draped in many layers of depth, making their characters both solid pillars and interesting ingredients within the plot as a whole. From Griffith's burning ambition to the skulduggery of the God Hand, from Puck and Isidro's antics to Farnese's troubled past and uncertain future, the characters all appear vivid and alive (Although alive might not fit The Skull Knight...) and all have their own emotions, personalities and ambitions. The supportive cast show their brilliance in how they appear to the reader as actual players in Berserk's grand game, and not just as passive plot devices.\n\nWith such a cast of strong personalities and vibrant, living characters, Berserk easily cuts it's way (no pun intended) to the top score in this category.\n\n\n\nEnjoyment - 10\n\nThe fact that I sat and read through all 295 chapters of this exquisite manga in one sitting should justify the perfect score for enjoyment! The manga has great characters - heroes you root for and empathize with, villains you can't help but admire for their ruthlessness and charisma. The artwork is dark, brooding, and gruesome and complements the story well. And what a riveting story it is... It hooks you from the first chapter and sets the stage for the most intriguing revenge themed manga on the market. Its success is testament to its quality. My only complaint is the excruciating waits between chapters.\n\nAlso, I must throw in a cautionary note: this manga is quite definitely not for the faint hearted. There is a considerable amount nudity, sex, gore, violence, and, for the lack of a better word, bad-assery!\n\n\n\nOVERALL - 9.69\n\n\n\nThis review is the final result of a review team composed of members from the &amp;quot;Critics and Connoisseurs&amp;quot; club.

I understand why they call it the pioneer of the isekai genre. Nowadays, every isekai anime uses the same tropes, but this show did them purposefully, complimenting the story in the process. It boasted stunning animation, a great soundtrack, and a sprawling fantasy setting rich with lore. What\u2019d you think, Panda? Panda: I agree the production values are top-notch. In my opinion, Mushoku Tensei has all of the trappings of a typical JRPG inspired fantasy, except with a repulsive, openly pedophilic main character. A randomloser died and got reincarnated as a child, except his old consciousness is always present\u2014it\u2019s a seemingly ordinary show until an adult child predator\u2019s voice starts narrating. On top of that, it\u2019s another wish-fulfillment isekai, even though it\u2019s not as apparent as most modern power fantasy anime. It seems different because it was written before all these tropes were done to death. Every season for the last six years, there have been dozens of \u2018ironic\u2019 and \u2018satirical\u2019 power fantasies. They don\u2019t bother pretending like they\u2019re not harems with overpowered protagonists. This story is different because it does the tropes, but without a veil of irony.\n\nAl: Rudeus works for his powers, unlike most isekai heroes. He reads books, practices his spell casting, and works on his sword-fighting technique. It\u2019s not like he was reborn as a god. There are plenty of times he is too weak to win a fight. Of course, he is an imperfect main character; this is a redemption story. Including pedophilia is the author\u2019s way of saying, if you can\u2019t handle this kind of content, don\u2019t continue.\n\nPanda: This is the kind of show that makes anime fans look bad. It is riddled with degenerate fan service, unnecessary sexualization, and the pedophile main character spoils all the enjoyment. The excessive use of sex and nudity is meant for titillation. I only saw a generic isekai with the same as any ecchi anime\u2014which is an excellent indicator of the target audience. None of this comes as a surprise, though. Apparently, the author was inspired by porn games, like Rance.  \n\nAl: To you, all nudity is excessive. If you weren\u2019t so sensitive, you\u2019d realize the anime has a nuanced portrayal of lust. Usually, anime don\u2019t realistically express sexuality\u2014panty shots, giant jiggly boobs. You know what I mean. But Mushoku Tensei realistically showcases genuine human desire, such as sex, longing, and masturbation. It\u2019s honestly refreshing. There\u2019s so much sex because of the time-period\u2014people didn\u2019t have phones or computers, sex was a way of occupying time. Members of royalty will boink maids in front of children because that\u2019s how the culture was. It\u2019s an essential part of every character\u2019s life. The story is historically accurate with added fantasy components. \n\nPanda: First of all, no. I like ecchi anime, one of my favorites is Interspecies Reviewers. Suppose Mushoku Tensei is \u201caccurate\u201d to the Middle Ages: Fantasy settings do not need to replicate every shitty aspect of the past. The author selected \u201cperversion\u201d as the thing he wanted to replicate. The only excuse is that he wished to keep it realistic? That\u2019s lazy writing at best. The story doesn\u2019t comment on why there is a constant perversion. It just is. The obvious answer is, men had more power than women, and consent was irrelevant to them. We see this with the strong male characters who lead the households, such as the fathers in the Greyrat family. They wield swords, sit at the end of the table, and have sex with whoever they want. Aside from that, there is nothing else historically accurate about it. \n\nAl: You\u2019re mistaken. When animating Mushoku Tensei, Studio Bind referenced art, technology, furniture, and decorations from the Middle Ages. The characters live in finely ornamented rooms. Households are accurately decorated depending on the family\u2019s social status. Not only is this historically accurate, but it adds depth to the world-building. \n\nPanda: All of these are great additions to the show\u2014but that\u2019s all they are. Extra coatings of paint to cover up the sleazy writing. There is a fine line between \u201cHow things used to be\u201d and \u201cHow I wish things would be.\u201d More often than not, Mushoku chooses the latter. Its lewd and lascivious portrayal of sexuality is in service of the male audience\u2019s fantasies: A girl masturbating outside of the bedroom, the maid is horny for the father, the parents loudly bang every night, and chances to have sex constantly land in the main character\u2019s lap. This world is a horny teenage boy\u2019s wet dream. Rudeus is the audience\u2019s proxy, and he comes close to being another badly written self-insert isekai protagonist.\n\nAl: Rudeus isn\u2019t a self-insert. He is a believable and relatable character. His portrayal of PTSD is exceptionally realistic. During the show, he gets nightmares and flashbacks to getting bullied in high school. The flashbacks are well-directed, too: the music becomes foreboding, and the scene becomes saturated with a blood-red filter. It\u2019s not like they happen at random times either. Whenever Rudeus reaches a turning point, such as leaving home and adjusting to his life as a teacher and setting out on a journey, his trauma resurfaces. If he\u2019s under severe stress, mainly in the final arc, he\u2019ll suddenly get thrown back to high school. Even though years have passed, he still experiences trauma because that\u2019s how it works in reality. Society conditioned him to become a pervert by bulling him into becoming a shut-in. \n\nPanda: I\u2019ll admit I loved how well Mushoku Tensei portrayed trauma\u2026 in theory. Without a doubt, it is the most emotionally resonant aspect of the show. I could empathize with his severe anxiety, but he pre because he was a pedophile. It may have been society\u2019s fault that he wasn\u2019t offered therapy. However, I cannot sympathize with a pedophile. He is not a good guy. He will never be a good guy. Saying it\u2019s \u201csociety\u2019s fault\u201d isn\u2019t an excuse. Perversion is a behavior he can control with restraint.\n\nAl: The show is about his redemption. The title is literally \u201cJobless Reincarnation\u201d because he is redeeming himself in a second chance at life. He begins as a loser, who couldn\u2019t care less about people. Then he becomes a more caring person\u2014helping to keep his family together and even risking his life to save people. That\u2019s why he makes nice friends like Sylphie. And he got a job to pay for both of them to go to magic school. He might be a pervert, but that\u2019s the point. Plus, Rudeus is a lolicon, not a pedophile. \n\nPanda: You\u2019re somewhat correct, there is a difference, but within the story, Rudeus is attracted to actual children. Writing an inhuman piece of garbage like Rudy, developing him into a half-decent person, then expecting us to praise him for doing the bare minimum is shoddy writing. And he can\u2019t even do that much! He preyed on family members in both his first and second life. Rudeus has the mind of a 40-year-old man, who 100% jacked off to child porn right before he died. Just because he threw himself in front of a truck to save a couple of kids doesn\u2019t make him a better person. He needs to do work towards becoming a better person\u2014and so far, it has been one step forward two steps back. Your description of his connections with family and friends are on point, except you\u2019re missing parts. Rudeus admits that he wants to \u2018groom\u2019 Sylphie to be his wife, which involves taking her to school with him. On the outside, it seems like an act of kindness, but in reality, he has sinister motivations.\n\nAl: Rudeus has the body of a child. How could a child be a pedophile?\n\nPanda: Hold the phone. Aren\u2019t you always the one who argues that lolis are legal as long as they\u2019re old enough? I could point to Rudeus\u2019s teacher, Roxy, and say she looks like a child, and the show has its own built-in fantasy logic to make her older than she looks. By your reasoning, both of them are adults. What\u2019s the difference?\n\nAl: Rudeus didn\u2019t have sex with her when she offered! She consented, and she\u2019s older than him. He didn\u2019t do anything illegal. You can\u2019t say he\u2019s a pedophile if he hasn\u2019t done anything. \n\nPanda: Even if what you said was true\u2014which it isn\u2019t\u2014doing the bare minimum isn\u2019t redemption. He is expected to save an innocent person\u2019s life and does not have sex with a kid. It\u2019s basic human decency! That\u2019s not something to applaud! That aside, he didn\u2019t even do the bare minimum. You twisted the truth. Rudeus groped Eris, a twelve-year-old girl, and tried to take off her panties while sleeping. He imagined having sex with her, and the only reason he didn\u2019t is that she got away before he could go all the way. He was fully willing to molest her!\n\nAl: Again, the story takes place in a fantasy realm during the Middle Ages; couples are encouraged to get married younger. Most fiction depicts morals based on the modern era, but that doesn\u2019t mean EVERY story must ignore the realities of the past. \n\nPanda: OK, you know why that\u2019s a bullshit excuse, right? Rudeus came from our world, where we have a moral framework that says \u201cRespect people\u2019s bodily autonomy\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t be a fucking child predator.\u201d \n\nAl: You\u2019re projecting your own morals onto a story that takes place in a different time and place. The only reason why you preach your moral purity like a saint is that you\u2019re too narrow-minded to divide fiction from reality. As someone who has been consuming anime for years now, I am capable of keeping reality and fiction far apart.\n\nPanda: Are all anime simply meaningless cartoons that can\u2019t comment on real-world issues? I reject that. Fiction is a means of communicating thoughts, emotions, stories. Even if a work of fiction makes me feel ashamed or guilty, like Mushoku Tensei obviously makes you feel, I will never undermine an entire art form by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s just fiction.\u201d Have some balls, for God\u2019s sake. If we generously assume the show is depicting real-world problems, it\u2019s doing it poorly. Such as Rudeus\u2019s pedophilia; the show endorses his actions. Even though he calls himself disgusting, there is no self-awareness. I doubt he will come to realize what he is and stop. Calling yourself \u2018scum\u2019 isn\u2019t enough. He is like a fan of degenerate anime, such as Eromanga sensei, who says, \u201cAnime is trash, and so am I.\u201d There\u2019s no nuance, it\u2019s just presenting repulsive aspects for either shock or fetishization. \n\nAl: Eventually, he will have consequences for his actions. This is part 1 of a 23 episode show. You\u2019re judging it too hastily.  \n\nPanda: When? The only so-called \u201cconsequence\u201d was him getting punched and kicked. The anime acknowledges Rudeus is a sick pedophile, then plays it off as a joke. In fact, it normalizes the pedophilic aspects. He refers to his cousin Eris as a little girl in most contexts because that\u2019s what she is. But when he gets a chance to make a move in the bedroom, he creepily calls her \u2018his\u2019 loli. The term \u2018loli\u2019 usually refers to a specific type of anime girl character design. In the real world, you don\u2019t call a little girl a loli. She is just a little girl. By calling her, a \u2018loli\u2019 separates Rudeus, and the audience, from any blame. This is the author\u2019s way of saying is that you don\u2019t need to feel shame for indulging in some sexual fantasies about prepubescent girls.\n\nAl: You fundamentally misunderstand the point of the show. We\u2019re not supposed to like Rudeus! Even in the synopsis, it says, \u201cHe\u2019s a pervert.\u201d What did you expect? Just because he\u2019s an immoral person doesn\u2019t make him a bad character.\n\nPanda: You\u2019re right, he is a pervert, and bad people aren\u2019t necessarily severely written characters. Whether or not I like Rudeus is irrelevant to whether or not he\u2019s a well-written character. What matters is: How does the story depict the ramifications of his negative choices? Does it condemn his actions or condone them? Does it focus on him or the person he hurt? In this case, he is always the focus. The other characters are unimportant\u2014and even when they do have a chance to voice their discomfort, the scenes are full of low camera angles, leering shots, and dehumanizing close-ups on breasts, thighs. It boils down to \u201cHaha, sexual assault,\u201d rather than painting him in a negative light. Even the decent female characters, like Roxy, are treated as objects. After the first two episodes, she only appeared in brief clips where she was constantly getting molested. \n\nAl: Have you ever thought you\u2019re taking anime too seriously?\n\nPanda: Have you ever thought that maybe you only defend Mushoku Tensei because you like Rudeus?\n\nAl: Come on man, really? You\u2019re just going to ignore all my arguments?\n\nPanda: Yeah, sorry that was uncalled for.\n\nAl: We at least agree the show has amazing production values, right?\n\nPanda: Absolutely. I loved seeing Rudeus and other mages cast their magic. I was shocked the author created a second language, and it didn\u2019t sound like gibberish. The voice actors did their job well, and the music fits without issues. I didn\u2019t like much about the characters, but there were some cool designs. It\u2019s commendable that they never simplified the designs. When the production cut corners, towards the end, it still looked far better than most TV anime. The hand-to-hand combat and sword fights are choreographed professionally. Alright, 8 for animation, 8 for sound, and 3 for the story and characters. Overall score: 3\/10\n\nAl: Whoa, don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a little unfair? It deserves at least a 7. \n\nPanda: Nope. This is my review, and I say it deserves a 3\/10. \n\nAl: Fine, whatever. Let\u2019s just watch some more anime. \n\nPanda: Let\u2019s. As long as it\u2019s not Mushoku Tensei.","episodes_watched":11,"scores":{"overall":3,"story":3,"animation":8,"sound":8,"character":3,"enjoyment":2},"entry":{"mal_id":39535,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/39535\/Mushoku_Tensei__Isekai_Ittara_Honki_Dasu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1530\/117776.jpg?s=6c5d46d9f12df98a070b5e0ea297ca6d","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1530\/117776t.jpg?s=6c5d46d9f12df98a070b5e0ea297ca6d","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1530\/117776l.jpg?s=6c5d46d9f12df98a070b5e0ea297ca6d"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1530\/117776.webp?s=6c5d46d9f12df98a070b5e0ea297ca6d","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1530\/117776t.webp?s=6c5d46d9f12df98a070b5e0ea297ca6d","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1530\/117776l.webp?s=6c5d46d9f12df98a070b5e0ea297ca6d"}},"title":"Mushoku Tensei: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu"},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/RebelPanda","username":"RebelPanda","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/4150781.jpg?t=1644861600"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/4150781.webp?t=1644861600"}}}}]}
