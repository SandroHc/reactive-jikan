During World War II, Miyazaki's father Katsuji was director of Miyazaki Airplane, owned by his brother (Hayao Miyazaki's uncle), which made rudders for A6M Zero fighter planes. During this time, Miyazaki drew airplanes and developed a lifelong fascination with aviation, a penchant that later manifested as a recurring theme in his films.\n\nMiyazaki's mother was a voracious reader who often questioned socially accepted norms. Miyazaki later said that he inherited his questioning and skeptical mind from her. His mother underwent treatment for spinal tuberculosis from 1947 until 1955, and so the family moved frequently. Miyazaki's film My Neighbor Totoro is set in that time period and features a family whose mother is similarly afflicted.\n\nMiyazaki attended Toyotama High School. In his third year there, he saw the film Hakujaden, which has been described as \"the first-ever Japanese feature length color anime.\" His interest in animation began in this period; however, in order to become an animator, he had to learn to draw the human figure, since his prior work had been limited to airplanes and battleships.\n\nAfter high school, Miyazaki attended Gakushuin University, from which he would graduate in 1963 with degrees in political science and economics. He was a member of the \"Children's Literature research club,\" the \"closest thing to a comics club in those days.\"\n\nIn April 1963, Miyazaki got a job at Toei Animation, working as an in-between artist on the anime Watchdog Bow Wow (Wanwan Chushingura). He was a leader in a labor dispute soon after his arrival, becoming chief secretary of Toei's labor union in 1964.\n\nIn October 1965, he married fellow animator Akemi Ota, who later left work to raise their two sons, Gor\u014d and Keisuke. Gor\u014d is now an animator and filmmaker, and has directed Tales from Earthsea at Studio Ghibli. Keisuke is a wood artist who has created pieces for the Ghibli Museum and who made the wood engraving shown in the Studio Ghibli film Whisper of the Heart.\n\nHayao Miyazaki's dedication to his work has often been reported to have impacted negatively his relationship with his son Gor\u014d. He has expressed that he doesn't wish to create a dynasty of animators and that his son has to create a name for himself.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":869,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/people\/869\/Saori_Hayami","website_url":"http:\/\/whv-amusic.com\/hayamisaori\/","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/voiceactors\/1\/66041.jpg"}},"name":"Saori Hayami","given_name":"\u6c99\u7e54","family_name":"\u65e9\u898b","alternate_names":["Saori Matsuo","\u677e\u5c3e \u6c99\u7e54"],"birthday":"1991-05-29T00:00:00+00:00","favorites":48158,"about":"Real name: Saori Matsuo (\u677e\u5c3e \u6c99\u7e54)\nBlood type: AB\nHeight: 164 cm\nHometown: Tokyo, Japan\n\nMember of duet \"Blue Drops\" with Yoshida Hitomi.\n\nTwitter: @hayami_official\nProfile: imenterprise.jp\/data.ph..."},{"mal_id":212,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/people\/212\/Daisuke_Ono","website_url":"http:\/\/daisukeono.com\/","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/voiceactors\/1\/54593.jpg"}},"name":"Daisuke Ono","given_name":"\u5927\u8f14","family_name":"\u5c0f\u91ce","alternate_names":["\u4e2d\u672c \u4f38\u8f14","Shinsuke Nakamoto","\u9f20\u5f8c\u8f29","Kouhai Nezumi"],"birthday":"1978-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","favorites":45644,"about":"Blood Type: O\nHeight: 175 cm (5'8.9\")\nWeight: 65 kg (143 lbs)\n\nOno Daisuke was affiliated with Aoni Production through its voice acting school and Mausu Promotion as his agency since the start of his voice acting career since 2001.
