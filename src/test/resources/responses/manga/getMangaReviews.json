My name is Hajime Isayama and today I'll teach you how to write manga. I must begin by saying that you should not be discouraged. At first glance, it can be difficult, but you only have to write 90 chapters perfectly tied together, with great characters and mystery to the world and titans, fantastic fights that actually serve a purpose with barely any talk no jutsu moments, and perhaps the single most important thing in all of this, Sasha being alive. What you ought to do afterward is write a timeskip. This is meant for the end-series so we canhave a \"where are they now\" segment but there is no need to worry about it because another timeskip will occur in the last chapter as we would have the pleasure of seeing in efficiency how terrible Eren's plan was. The first timeskip is primarily meant as a means of showing Eren becoming this evil incarnate that at no point in the series have we gotten hits about such alteration to his character. The second one is instead a quick reminder of how Yams got worse at writing a proper story without contrivance to its characters. Both are meant for Eren as he's convinced that all lives must be taken in order to obtain \"freedom\" and in doing so he ought to go against his friends causing an artificial conflict between him and the rest of Paradis as well countless third parties in which for entirely redundant reasons will join Paradis side and go against Eren. From this point onwards, you don't have to write anything decent since it will all depend on which character is to your liking the most and you'll always have to make him or her achieve whatever goal they are in need of. In this case, it's Armin. He's mastered the talk no Jutsu, I dare to say it's his strongest technique. Anyone he's talked to has been convinced to help him do whatever he's wanted to and its limits know no bounds.\n\nWith the power of friendship, Armin doesn't give up, not for one moment while he and co-venture towards Eren to stop him but first, we must go a bit before all that because you are clearly asking how all those characters have joined the Paradis side. Because of plot device, they ultimately were there because Eren too changed sides and there was no choice but to help their enemies. The two couldn't stay on one side only since that wouldn't make sense, just like it doesn't make any sense for Reiner, Pieck, and others to help Armin and Mikasa, meant solely as an excuse for \"redemption\" for some of the characters. Armin succeeds because of course, he did, Eren becomes dove because of course, he did, we never learn much about the titans and the few things we get to throw at us are pure nonsense in an asspull way upon the \"paths\" was introduced into the story which, for all intents and purposes is the main reason why the second arc of the timeskip is this bad. Historia getting sidelined from the story by getting pregnant off of some random farmer we never know anything about, which it's not the fact the child is not Eren's that pissed me off, but rather that she could've done so much that being someone's whore. To top it all, Eren Lelouch'd his ass out of and acts like he did something important or useful when all he did was fight for something he himself committed. I always knew he was going to do that the moment he becomes evil for the greater good but never wanted to believe it as I knew it wouldn't work with the story itself.\n\nAll the troubles Eren went through, all the people he killed, were just for his friends to live happily ever after. Instead of removing the titan course and finishing what he initially wanted to, he follows the most bullshit route and makes peace for a few generations... slightly for his friends to live their miserable life in complete serenity and with this in mind, the descendants to be inevitably killed. There is no point in taking so many lives when everything remains the same and what Eren has fought so far becomes useless because his goal was suddenly retconned when he confessed his \"love\" to Mikasa all of a sudden. Especially when you murdered 80% of the population and would've taken a mere couple of hours to exterminate the rest and finally be free of the burden. Even if Eren had somehow died because of that, it's still a better outcome of what we've got although it needs to once again be mentioned that what led to that would've been abominable regardless. It can't get out of character than this, and it makes no sense either given how Mikasa got to suck Horse's dick anyway. I wonder what Dove-Eren must've felt when he saw Mikasa getting fucked by the only person he didn't want to fuck her. I bet it's not sitting well with him.\n\n\"Thank you Eren for turning yourself into a mass-murder for our sake\"\n\nIf you want more proof that Armin is the most hateful character, here you go. Eren is the worst character, but Armin is someone you would hate the moment he opens his mouth. When Armin mastered the talk-no-Jutsu it was as clear as day that he was going to succeed in convincing all of the previous enemies into joining his side to take down Eren, which he does, and that he had a plan into making Eren stop but think about it, why would Eren stop and how would Armin make that happen? Apparently, Armin never thought about the consequences, and the whole reason why he did all that in the first place was that it was against genocide, that there had to be a better option to put an end to this and in the last chapter he goes \"Thank you for killing all them fuckers\". What could have possibly happened between his determination to stop Eren and the last chapter that made him accept Eren's behavior and get along with everything he's done? Armin who is not only the brain of the trio, but was always been morally right, and looking back at everything he's always made the right and acceptable decision to put an end to something but in the last chapter he comes across as disingenuous and a piece of shit with virtually no fucking reason that let him to the settlement.\n\nAs for tradition, a good lead female in shonen is hard to come by and Mikasa is no exception. You won't certainly hate her as much as Eren and Armin but will sure get on your nerves with her stoic persona throughout. In the early series, she's got something to work with and her strength was admirable so for all the good reasons she was reliable in that department. I always liked her early on but looking back it's clear Yams either didn't care much about her or perhaps wasn't able to give her more stuff to do as the story went on, which I find extremely odd given how in the post timeskip she was suddenly given more importance than before but ended up being a leftover until the last two chapters gaining the determination to do the thing she should have done a long time ago. Mikasa is a bit awesome in her own way, but she has no ambitions of any kind and comes across as Eren's shadow. It is clear that she has had mental issues since she was a kid from the accident she and Eren had and her affection for Eren is due to this, but Yams does not look into this with the possibility that she may recover one day. Eren seemingly hating her was an excuse to make her grow and act on her own rather than following in his footsteps but she does nothing the entire time besides feeling sad at Eren's sentiments towards her because Yams never gave a shit about her.\n\nI haven't talked about the rest of the characters but really, what there is to talk about? They all suck because the writing sucks and the story shifted from average (Marley) to the worst thing (War for Paradis) in a dozen or so chapters and it destroys everyone's solid characterization they once had. The transition from Eren becoming evil and after meeting Ymir was awful and the premise itself was bad, to begin with, because it didn't build up to characters that would eventually join the Paradis side to defeat a common enemy. It does this by assuming that everyone is fine in the first place, while that couldn't be feasible in any way. Yams wanted to give the characters more depth but clearly couldn't work with the way they were presented in the first place and also goes against their characters as previously they wanted to defeat Eren as quickly as possible without taking out everyone and yet waste time for trivial stuff. A \"goal\" of any of the characters who weren't on Eren's side, vanish because the final moments of the story is them trying to reach and take down Eren and in the midst of all the chaos down there, it's impossible to get any devolvement, and they don't, so Yams had to put Floch as a mini-boss before the final event as a means of showing the \"cooperation\" of the two sides of which couldn't work but the shitty writing proved me otherwise.\n\nWhich is better, the journey or the destination? The answer is both. But can everyone get that luxury? Unfortunately not. What one must do to get near to said luxury? Make the journey be worth the destination. If the AoT story had followed this thought of mine, it would've made sense. What was only needed is a linear thread to follow and find its end without splitting into different directions because you wanted to make it a more compelling approach to your story. You could, but why risk it when you had the answer right in the palm of your hand?\n\nEren died a virgin.

Were they meaningless?\" -Erwin Smith Yes, Erwin, their lives were meaningless. -THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS- Attack on Titan was a great manga until Isayama experienced burnout after chapter 123. I wanted to believe he will write a great ending despite the quality of writing decreasing in the last arc (Ch. 123-139). And it wasn't a delusional expectation. There were some chapters that are great in the last arc, and he was saying he planned the ending from the start, which was a believable statement since there were too many foreshadowings in the early chapters. But it turned out that was a lie.Nobody can make me believe this ending was the one Isayama planned from the start. I don't know what happened. Maybe the editors made him rush the story, or he just get bored from AoT and wanted to finish it as soon as possible. Well, the reason is unimportant at this point since one of my favorite mangas got ruined by a trainwreck end game arc, and one of the worst finals in history.\n\nThe Rumbling arc is full of asspulls, dogshit writings, character assassinations, retcons, and Marvel moments. Eren becomes the absolute evil for saving Paradis and starts rumbling with an amazing plan in his head, or we thought like that because we learn Eren didn't have a plan in the last chapter, he just went with the flow. That's the first hit to Eren's great character in Marley and War for Paradis arcs. And the second hit comes from turning him into an incel. He says he doesn't want Mikasa to be with another man after his death. In that panel I wasn't sure whether it's a serious translation or someone is trolling me. It was a waste of a page since nothing was explained in the last chapter. What happened to the hallucigenia monster? What's the point of Rumbling if he didn't have a plan, wouldn't something like he did in Liberio work for making him look like absolute evil? These questions have no answers. And top of that Isayama gave Ymir a shitty Stockholm syndrome and turned her into a \"HARDER DADDY\" character, and \"REVEALED\" the key character in this story was neither Eren nor Armin. It was MIKASA! Why? Because she's the fan favorite character, and Isayama needs to make Eren x Mikasa ship cannon! Bullshit... Eren and Mikasa never had a romantic development. Even Hange has more romantic development with Eren. But, all of a sudden, we learned Eren actually loved Mikasa all along! And the delivery panel of this \"TRUTH\" was so bad I wanted to throw my phone out of the window while reading that.\n\nOh, also don't forget the fact Eren killed his own mother (I can't watch\/read the \"Tell me, Reiner, why did my mom had to die?\" scene without laughing anymore). He could make Dina eat Berthold, so they would have a Colossal Titan with royal blood, but no. Let's make her eat his mother so he can hate titans even more, which could be done by a random titan instead of Dina. Also, the funniest part, in my opinion, Paradis is still at war with other nations after Eren's death. He died and took titan powers from Eldians for nothing. Probably other nations will wipe out Eldians from existence in the next 10 years since everyone still hates them due to Rumbling killed so many families.\n\nIf you are okay with creating your headcanon and sticking to it, then you can still read the first 123 chapters. It's one of the best stories I've ever read. It starts with some questionable writing because Isayama was busy with dissing to the Shounen Jump series since he get rejected by the Shounen Jump. Characters were screaming how they will be hero and then suddenly die. If this isn't a shounen parody, I don't know what it is. But it starts to be good with Female Titan and Clash of Titans arcs. And with these two arcs, we slowly but surely start to learn more about AoT's world. With every new arc, new info appears. We are trying to reach to the truth with the characters, the truth behind the titans is a total mystery and when we learn the truth, everything changes. It was a mind blowing reveal, and we wondered what will happen next. And we didn't get disappointed in the next arcs. Marley and War for Paradis arcs are full of character developments and politics. They have amazing dialogues, especially chapters 120-122. These chapters are one of the peaks AoT and prove Isayama is a great writer. But then, everything falls apart. So, if you came here after watching all seasons of AoT (except for season 4 part 2, if you are reading this after March 2022) just read chapters 117-123, and stick to your head cannon. You can still read it from the start for seeing the differences between anime and manga. There are a lot of differences between them, but the most crucial one is the differences in Uprising Arc (Season 3 Part 1 in the anime). However, if you don't want to read the manga but still read my review (I assume you don't care much about AoT but still watch the anime adaptation), then drop the anime after 5th episode of Season 4 Part 2, and create your own head canon.\n\nThe final conclusion destroyed all of the good things about previous arcs for me. The deaths of Survey Corps were meaningless. Everyone we knew in the first 90 chapters died for nothing. If I was a Survey Corps member who was killed by titans, I would beat Eren in the afterlife.\n\nIn the end, Erwin died just for a blonde crybaby can f*ck with the murderer of Petra. I hope I can get my vaccine as soon as possible, so I can fly to Japan and do what everyone wants in Isayama's onsen.\n\nPS: I was avoiding reading the extra 8 chapters \u2500which are released after I wrote this review\u2500 for a long time, but I finally read them, and I couldn't believe what I saw. Even though it wasn't in only 10 years like I predicted, they still wiped out Eldians from existence. Isayama, what a man you are! I bet I won't forget this ending at least for 10 years! I decreased my score for the manga to 1 from 3 after these extra pages. The whole Rumbling Arc is just Code Geass' ending done wrong.","chapters_read":139,"scores":{"overall":1,"story":1,"art":5,"character":3,"enjoyment":1},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/SenbeiPan","username":"SenbeiPan","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/7176715.jpg?t=1645109400"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/7176715.webp?t=1645109400"}}}},{"mal_id":390688,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=390688","type":"manga","votes":894,"date":"2021-04-08T09:28:00+00:00","review":"Attack of Titan is the prime example of how a story \u2013no matter how good it is\u2013 can get completely and absolutely ruined in an amount of just a few chapters. That is, if you try hard enough, of course. Attack of Titan doesn\u2019t need any introduction, ever since the anime debut in 2013 it has been one of the most popular and recognizable franchises out there, but in the end, it all boils down to one simple question: is it good? To avoid you all the trouble, the answer is simply no. I have to admit that I used to like Attack on Titan, and evenfor a while it was one of my favorite series, and it was for a good reason. What Hajime Isayama initially presented in Attack on Titan wasn\u2019t a run-of-the-mill shounen, but a superb story accompanied with intricate mysteries and world-building, and while Attack on Titan has never been without its issues, those could be overlooked as the good had far outweighed the bad. But what are we seeing now, however, it\u2019s nothing but a hollow, lame and plain uninspired imitation of what AoT used to be.\n\nWhat happened in Attack on Titan couldn\u2019t be described as anything other than a huge downgrade in writing, showing signs of this as early as chapter 124, but becoming much more apparent in the last 6 chapters, culminating in what in my opinion is one of the worst end of any story I've seen so far. It\u2019s completely nonsensical and contrived without any thematic weight, throwing away any previous build-up or foreshadowing, which it\u2019s not only bad for itself, but also retroactively makes a lot of previous scenes as basically worthless. And not to mention how almost every character in the cast has been replaced by watered-down version of themselves, Eren being one of the worst offenders. While initially not the most developed character (though this is up to debate), Eren had one of the best character arcs in the series, just to be absolutely ruined in the exact amount of two chapters (which also are the last two), making his entire character feel like a bad joke. It's actually quite an accomplishment how much of Eren's character has been destroyed in such a short amount of time. The worst thing about this is that it doesn't only happen to Eren, but to most of the cast.\n\nArmin, for example, is another victim of bad writing. After RtS, he remains completely stagnant and even regresses as a character, as he\u2019s shown without any of the determination or development that took place during that arc, but rather appears as a very passive character, reminiscent of earlier parts of the story. Despite that being bad writing, that wouldn\u2019t be so bad if it wasn\u2019t for how much the story loves his character, despite doing nothing to deserve that. He\u2019s always shown as some kind of messiah that every character loves for no real reason and paradoxically has the most screen time (at the expense of other characters) but the least development. It's insane how much Isayama constantly tries to portray Armin as a genius and a hero just to fails so terribly at it.\n\nThen there\u2019s Mikasa, who doesn\u2019t even has any development or remarkable trait other than \"Ereh\" (and acting cool I guess), and has been like that for pretty much the entirety of the series. Thankfully though, she finally gets some development... but it\u2019s only in the final two chapters. Which of course means that said development is completely rushed and contrived. \n\nAs for the other characters, they are underdeveloped by the lack of screen time due to the sheer amount of characters in the story, so just a few characters get some significant development. Another problem is how the story (and thus its characters) loves Armin, even going as far as ruining characters that aren\u2019t even alive to begin with for the sake of Armin. The only characters that are an exception to this are the character who dares to oppose Armin, who are pretty much next to none outside of Floch (best character) and some non-characters that no one actually bothers to remember. \n\nAnyways, I could go on with the rest of the cast, like how Levi, despite being one of the few decent character remaining, gets very few development or any moment to shine in the final arc due barely having any screen time with his character reduced to muh promise (still like I said before he\u2019s one of better ones), or how Gabi\u2019s characters serves no thematic purpose other than to tell us the exact same thing that Reiner\u2019s character already did just a few chapters ago.\n\nStory-wise, things aren\u2019t much better. Due to what happens in the final arc, a lot (if not all) of the themes that the story initially presented are rendered as worthless. While the earlier parts of the story had been of mostly respectable quality, with a clear foreshadowing of future events and a solid theming, there\u2019s no a reason to care about that now as Isayama didn\u2019t seem to care either when he wrote this ending. It was as if after chapter 123 he was replaced with another writer as there is a clear lack of foresight in the following chapters regarding the development of the plot, especially in comparison with the earlier chapters. However, the worst part of this is the number of possible directions the series could have gone, only to ultimately pick the laziest and most predictable story development that the story could have gone. Laziness in particular is a recurrence during the final arc. The characters face no real threat despite the situation they\u2019re in due to how protected they are by the plot, resulting in a lot of situations devoid of any logic no matter how unlikely these situations are and any tension being basically non-existent. Not much can be said about the ending without getting into some major spoilers, but it did its job of ruining whatever foundation the story previously had.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting how unsubtle the symbolism and the \"\"\"\"themes\"\"\" are during the final arc. I cannot count the number of times a character has said \"I am free\" or also whenever a bird appears for the gorillionth time representing freedom (such deep symbolism). Like, it\u2019s ok, we get it, but don't shove it in my face for the tenth time in a row, it's exhausting.\n\nAs for the art, it\u2019s a mixed bag. The art initially was very mediocre and inconsistent, but with the time it got better and there was a clear improvement, it wasn\u2019t the best of the best, but it was decent. However after a certain point the art got much more inconsistent again with a lack of effort compared to the previous improvements. Said lack of effort coincidentally happens to be reflected in the story, as the best chapters are also those with the best art, while the poorest written chapters have a mediocre art. \n\nTo say that the final arc is bad would be an understatement. Other than two chapters, there is little good to see. Any share of consistency or logic is completely erased and the attempt of making something of actual substance is left as an afterthought. It makes any previous emotional investment I had with this manga purposeless and I just can't care about anything related to it now. I think it's obvious by now, but I don't recommend Attack on Titan. If you still plan on reading Attack on Titan, then I recommend to read it until 123, then drop it and make up your own ending, as it would be much more satisfying than the ending we got, otherwise don't bother.","chapters_read":139,"scores":{"overall":4,"story":0,"art":0,"character":0,"enjoyment":0},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/PraiseTheSun123","username":"PraiseTheSun123","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/8582650.jpg?t=1620484200"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/8582650.webp?t=1620484200"}}}},{"mal_id":390666,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=390666","type":"manga","votes":603,"date":"2021-04-08T09:06:00+00:00","review":"---The review contains plot spoilers--- \"Bruh\" - Everyone that read the final chapter of AOT. Despite the underwhelming (or I could even say horrible) ending, Attack on Titan has been one of the best manga I have ever read. The manga has amazing well-written characters with the ability to generate some of the best character interactions I have ever seen in any story. The underground scene after the timeskip and the ability to dive deep into the psychology of each character is way too good. The ending is horrible I agree and it kinda breaks a lot of what has been built upon it so far butimo, the whole build up to ch.123 and some of the chapters in between are why I give it an 7\/10.\n\nThe characters themselves are what makes the manga special. I loved how unique the cast was, from the 2 best characters in the manga Reiner and Erwin (Eren was 1st before final chapter) to all the other side characters like Riko. They were so different and their ideologies were presented in a way that made you relate to them. A scene like Marco's death reveal is something I watch a lot simply because of how different it was and the nature of everything surrounding it. The cast was great which is why I understand how anyone could hate the manga for the way it ended.\n\nThe plot was great as well, the manga's development from titan fights to deep human psychological battles and politics was brilliant. It felt natural and with time, the plot evolved and the characters evolved with it which is why it felt both natural and rewarding when seeing a certain fight or reaching a decisive point.\n\nThose were the reason I gave it a 9 or even a 10\/10 at some point. On the other hand, the manga had way too many asspulls, some that even broke logic of the titans and their powers. There were way too many plot holes that didn't even get covered after the final chapter. You could have easily taken out like 10 out of the last 20 chapters and very little would have changed. \nAll that combined with the ending tho, it falls down to an 7 tho I could easily give it less. The final chapter was that bad!\n\nOverall, I would give Shingeki no Kyojin an 7\/10. Could have been a masterpiece but Isayama had other ideas.\nIDK if I would recommend it based on how bad the ending was.","chapters_read":139,"scores":{"overall":7,"story":7,"art":8,"character":7,"enjoyment":7},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/RPWPA","username":"RPWPA","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/4063361.jpg?t=1645043400"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/4063361.webp?t=1645043400"}}}},{"mal_id":389991,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=389991","type":"manga","votes":568,"date":"2021-04-06T03:40:00+00:00","review":"--The review contains spoilers-- I had to completely redo my review, and went from the score of 1 to 10. I've actually reread the entire manga in a single night, and came to a different conclusion. This review is 100% spoilers and an attempt at explaining the divisive ending, so don't read it if you're just starting. If it helps, know that I've spent 11 years reading it, and reread it many times so I could form this opinion, meaning that my rating holds weight, and you won't be making a mistake if you choose to read this manga. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- While I do understand the anger of thefandom, there's one really big problem with the arguments you guys put out. It seems that literally none of you understand who and what Eren Yeager is.\n \nNow, I'll be honest with you. I was also an \"Erenchad\", I also rooted for genocide. 139 hit me like a truck, I was pissed for hours. Why would he end it like this? He effectively backtracks on all his beliefs. A complete 180. Then I calmed down, and started thinking.\n \nDid Isayama mess up the ending, or did I not understand Eren at all?\n \n \nLet's start at the beginning. Eren Yeager was born as the most unfortunate piece of shit on the planet. There's a reason he says \"I'm not really sure why I did it\". Look at his baby eyes in 139. The moment Ymir made contact with that parasite, Eren Yeager was destined for doom. It's quite silly when you think about it - the man who represented freedom - was the one farthest away from it. Him saving Mikasa in the cabin, getting her to follow him, and everything after it - wasn't Erens doing. The poor guy was acting on reflexes of a long dead demigod, who needed Mikasa for some reason to be free.\n \nNow we come to 2 Erens that make this story - pre future memories, and post future memories Eren. Pre future, as you can probably guess, is Eren before getting his memories when he kissed Historias hand. Ymirs grasp over him wasn't that strong at the time. However, contact with royal blood allowed Ymir to wake up inside him. At that precise moment, Eren Yeager died, and was no more. He was nothing more than a complete vessel for Ymir. And that perfectly explains every action of his from now on then. Imagine if you knew you were going to die in 4 years, while killing 80% of the population. You also find out that it was YOU who killed your own mother. Erens entire persona was based on avenging his mom. IMAGINE what all those revelations do to the psyche of a then 15 - now 19 year old boy. A kid.\n \n1) You are solely responsible for the deaths of your closest friends\n2) You killed your own father and mother\n3) You will force your own friends to kill you later on\n4) No matter what happens, you leave the world blind, and you won't know if Eldians will actually survive\n \n&gt;Hur dur explain his sudden love for Mikasa\n \nWell, it was always there. Back then, the world was surrounded with human eating monsters, his mother has died, and he just found out he's one of the monsters - do you think he can afford a relationship with Mikasa? He swept all his personal feelings under the carpet. Despite not showing it well, he was extremely glad he had Armin and Mikasa in his life. You could also make an argument that his love and attachment to Mikasa was all Ymirs doing - we will never know.\n \nYou simply have to understand Eren Yeager after he got future memories. He died, then and there. What took over was a persona that knew of his doom, and the suffering he would cause to everyone around him, the fact he killed his own mother, as well. And on top of that, he had to play pretend as a sinister lunatic, force Yeagerists into a plan that will kill them all, for essentially nothing, break his bonds with Mikasa and Armin - and this is especially important, as the last 2 people on the planet that trusted him back then - were those 2. He knew there was no way out. He had to go to Liberio and kill innocent people. A big hint of all of this is his talk with Ramzi - that turkish boy. That's where real Eren peeked out for a second. Literally, what's the point in saving the kid? I'm forced into killing him later, anyway. For a resolution I'm not sure of. To \"free\" a creature I know nothing of.

I could almost say that everything I am today is because of Attack on Titan. This is the series I loved with all my heart. I bought all chapters and volumes no matter how long they took to arrive and have the DVD of all seasons. But today, I want to burn them all. From chapter 1 to 124 is peak fiction, greatest writing I've ever seen in all of literature. Featuring themes like slavery and racism.It was perfect. Great characters, I found myself sympathizing with the enemies, that's how greatly written they were. Story was out of this world. Eren was a fine example of what war could do to a man, a man who kept losing his friends and families. Marvellous pacing. Amazing action. Great mysteries. Great character motivations. Everything is absolutely amazing, everything WAS absolutely amazing.\n\nThen Isayama decided to go to fanfiction.net and took the worst story out of all from the catalog of dogshit, and adapted that. The one fanfiction with Levi and Erwin having gay sex had a better ending than this bullcrap, and I'm 20% homophobic ahahahaha. How does an idiot do this? I'm genuinely asking. How does a person fuck up so bad? How does a person who wrote chapters like 121, FUCK UP THIS BAD? Making one plot hole after another, not giving a shit about character consistency, not giving a shit about tonal consistency, not giving a shit about how the readers feel?\n\nIsayama randomly forgot about what drives Eren as a character, and made him into the biggest betacuck loser I've seen in all of anime. I would've been fine with him losing the war to prove a point. But no, he just gambled the future of the people of Ymir because he felt like it, and turned into a fucking simp at the ending. He doesn't want Mikasa to be taken by someone else, and at the same time he distances himself from Mikasa, and at the same time he cries about how he wants to be with them. Then there's Armin with his \"Listen up Minna!!\" speech, popping out of nowhere to give people the most nonsensical speech and surprisingly everyone would listen to his ass. Then there's Reiner, who is the biggest cocksucker in the entire series. Everything he went through, Marcel's sacrifice and all that, amounted to him becoming  a letter sniffing creep. And he is supposed to be Isayama's favourite character, what a pathetic joke. There was no consequences for his actions, neither was there for Annie's or Gabi's. The PTSD crybaby never achieved his peace neither received his consequences. Nice message Isayama.\nHistoria's pregnancy was the most useless sub-plot in the entirety of the story and amounted to absolutely NOTHING. She married some no-name bully from her childhood that used to throw rocks at her. Isayama gave me my favourite ship, Ymir and the abusive King Fritz. The only explanation we got for their love was \"She likes her... because she likes her.. okay?? p.s he has a big cock\"\n\nI thought Attack on Titan was different than other shounen, it really knew how to write it's female characters, but I was a fucking fool. Their character arcs were downright insulting and trash. This proves how Isayama is no different from Kishomoto. I remember everyone praising Isayama, \"He is such a great writer who knows how to properly write complex female characters in shounen without them relying on romance or sexualization\" And to think this manga was praised as a great representation of female characters. What a fucking fool I was.\nWhat was a story that stayed far away from topics like romance, became a fucking Shoujo manga in just ONE FUCKING CHAPTER. Forced character relationships that are supposed to make sense, how could people be happy with that?\n\nDespite the endless possibilities for the outcome of this story, despite the divisive nature of the fandom, he managed to create an ending that literally everyone hates. What a remarkable feat from the biggest clown in all of manga industry.\n\nNever has the ending of a story brought down the entire manga THIS bad. And I've watched Darling in the FranXX, Game of Thrones, How I Met Your Mother, Death Note, Future Diary, Erased.\n\nI actually consider myself the one of the biggest Attack on Titan fan, I've never missed a convention and the opportunity to cosplay as my favourite scout, I never left the opportunity to advertise Attack on Titan to non-anime fans, I'm pretty sure I've gotten at least 50 people into Attack on Titan and anime, I've always dickrode Isayama and said that he deserves a Nobel Prize of Literature for his insane writing, I never left the chance to defend Attack on Titan. I re-watched all seasons at least 3 times and read onto Attack on Titan's lore to try and justify each and every single plot point of it, so no one could call it bad. I've found an amazing community online, wrote theories and predictions. And now, we're at this stage.\n \nJust as I invited all my friends over to read the final chapter together, I started the chapter with a glimmer of hope, shiny eyes and a big smile on my face, as I was hoping that Isayama would pull one final twist to end everything perfectly, leaving no room for plot-holes, marking Attack on Titan as the best written Shounen in the history of anime, as I kept reading, my smile slowly turned into a frown. I'm dumping my rating systems because I don't care about anything anymore.\n\nNow I'll take a break from anime and manga altogether. I'm not quitting forever, I just need to take a break. This series was everything to me. I have lost all taste, the food that I'm eating is literally tasteless to me, and no this isn't Corona, this is from the pure disappointment and disgust from chapter 139's writing. I temporarily quit.","chapters_read":139,"scores":{"overall":2,"story":0,"art":0,"character":0,"enjoyment":0},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Twumi","username":"Twumi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/10403824.jpg?t=1619770800"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/10403824.webp?t=1619770800"}}}},{"mal_id":41564,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=41564","type":"manga","votes":820,"date":"2011-08-15T21:53:00+00:00","review":"I was unsure if I would ever find another manga good enough to deserve my reviewing. And after reading volume six of Shingeki no Kyojin I can safely say the wait is over. What a manga! STORY: 9\/10 Throughout the history of action manga there have been hordes of fantastically evil creatures ganging up on any shounen hero that dares get in their way. Whether it be demons, hollows, or demons again one thing was always certain: Even though the characters appeared scared you knew everything would be okay. A main character can't die to one random monster out of the horde. They deserve noble deaths viahuman vs human fights. \n\nShingeki no Kyojin abandons decades of stereotypes and does it in remarkable fashion. Never have I been so afraid, so physically frightened by \"just another mob of pure evil monsters\". In Shingeki the monster of choice happens to be giants. They don't have any special powers and in fact they aren't particularly massive considering they're giants. They walk, run, and even crawl around on the ground with blank, sometimes even silly faces and do nothing but eat and mangle every human in sight. This is something the mangaka has perfected despite the fact that this is the first manga he's ever written. Every single time a giant appears on the page your heart will start racing and your palms will become sweaty. Where do they come from and why do they devour humans despite having no anatomical need for it?\n\nThese are all questions the mangaka presents early and skillfully hasn't answered yet. He's also created an incredibly thought-out world with paragraphs at the end of most chapters explaining things that would bore readers if squeezed into speech bubbles. Including, but not limited to: three-dimensional flying gear, anatomy of a giant, construction of the cities three walls, battle formations, and a type of strange retractable sword. The world feels rich and thought-out and will almost certainly suck in anyone who gives Shingeki no Kyojin a chance.\n\nART: 8\/10\nI'm going to be perfectly honest and say that the artwork in the first two volumes is as close to shit as it gets. Actions aren't drawn very well, details aren't drawn very well, and its clear the mangaka had trouble drawing body proportions. But when volume three started it was almost like a switch was flipped and the art wasn't nearly as bad anymore. In fact, after having just finished the sixth volume, its among some of the better art I've seen in a manga. Characters are drawn very different from one another and have a crisp yet visibly sketchy feel to them. And the Giants! They slide around with their giant heads, oddly proportioned bodies, and silly facial expressions just creeping the shit out of me. The mangaka is very talented at drawing characters experiencing the scariest moment of their entire lives. What a bonus the art became in volume three, adding fear on top of fear to make one of the most chilling manga experiences even more so.\n\nCHARACTER: 9\/10\nEverybody is somebody. \"What's the point of writing about a character with no personality or back story?\" - Is what I imagine the mangaka asks himself before deciding to throw a new character into the mix. You'll find no blank-faced bad asses in this manga. You also won't find too many people with happy child-hoods either. Even though this is listed as a shounen it deals with very dark themes more suited for a seinen. Characters are often showed rattled and sometimes mentally scared from seeing their comrades get their heads bitten off in front of them. Either way, there is plenty of page time devoted to understanding characters and their roots.\n\nENJOYMENT: 10\/10\nThe depth of the world is immense.\nThe art is very good (eventually).\nCharacters are deep.\nThe suspense is great.\nThe giants are TERRIFYING!\nIt's rare to find a manga that does so many different things so well. Whenever a new volume comes out I always know I'm in for another great experience I can't get anywhere else.\n\nOVERALL: 9\/10\nI can't give a perfect score to a manga with so few chapters so early in it's life span. But trust me; if the same amount of enjoyment I've experience in the first six volumes continues throughout the rest of the series it would be a 10 no doubt. \n\nYou've gotta give this manga a shot. It's doing things that haven't really been done before, or at least not to this level. I'm setting the standard right now: You can't call yourself a fan of manga without reading Shingeki no Kyojin. Now get reading!\n\n*This review made possible by AironicallyHuman, who recommended this manga to me","chapters_read":22,"scores":{"overall":9,"story":9,"art":8,"character":9,"enjoyment":10},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Tumerking","username":"Tumerking","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/197819.jpg?t=1645006800"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/197819.webp?t=1645006800"}}}},{"mal_id":182585,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=182585","type":"manga","votes":565,"date":"2015-03-17T23:44:00+00:00","review":"Shingeki no kyojin otherwise known as Attack on Titan. This series before the anime wasn't popular in the west, but it was fairly popular in Japan being in the top 15\/10 best selling manga in 2011\/2012. After the airing of the anime it became a mega hit series. Now before you give this review a not helpful vote because of the 10\/10 score. At least read what I have to say before doing your deed. I'm more interested that you guys read my review than anything else. Now let's begin! \"Spoiler free review!\" Story: 10\/10. The plot\/story IMO is snk strongest point. \"Titans\" these monstrous looking creatures thatcomes in different shapes and size. Their main and only goal is to eat \"humans\" 100 years ago humans where forced to live Inside the walls which are over 50 meters tall, to stop the titans from getting in. This series is full of mysteries for eg. who or what created the walls? Are titans natural creatures? Who created titan shifters? Why were they created? This is just a small dose of the amount of mysteries in snk. Snk is a mystery series with horror elements in it. The plot\/story is snk strongest point, but it can be a disadvantage to the series itself. Why? Because the story is setup in a way where it doesn't spoon feed you answers right away, and if the readers don't pay attention to the story. They will forget things that were earlier \"foreshadowed\" also the series being a monthly manga doesn't help. A lot of complaint I've heard about the series is that it feels like the author is making up things as it goes or pulling things out of his ass. Now this isn't the case. Snk is one of those series that gets better when you reread it. When you reread the series you will see the amount of foreshadowing\/hints the author puts in the early chapters of the series. Things that has been foreshadowed in the very first volume is now being answered currently in the latest chapters of the manga. What does this tells you? It tells you that the author has planned out everything already, and he already knows how the story will conclude. The world building in snk is impressive! The amount of details the author puts in his world building is just great. Thd mysteries of the series and the overall plot is just so engaging. You just want to know the answers. This is one of the reasons snk has a lot of theory threads around the net. You know the TV series called \"lost\" that's the vibes I get from snk story. Except snk will answer our question and not give us any bullshit....I'm not going to go there. Anyways read over this series at least once. You will have a better understanding of the overall plot. And you will be less likely to ask stupid questions. Sadly not everyone is willing or have the time to read over the series. Sigh.\n\nArt: 8\/10. You guys must be saying in your mind. \"what!? O.O 8\/10 for snk art? fanboy alert!\" lol, let me explain why I gave it a 8\/10. At first I didn't like the art. But I slowly started to like the art. The main reason is because the roughness in the art fits the horror theme very well In this series, I don't think the series would successfully have the \"horror\" feel to it if it had something like, the Levi spin off manga. I do have to say I don't think the art is as bad as people are making it out to be. I think the scan is mostly at fault for this, if you buy the actual volume you will notice it looks much better than the online scans. Compare crunchy roll scans with manga panda and mangastream scans you will see a difference in quality.\n\nCharacters: 8\/10. A lot of people say snk characters are flat\/one dimensional. You will also notice that most of the peeps that said it are anime only viewers. Now, the first 30+ chapters which is basically the 1st season of the anime are mostly use to introduce us to the big cast of characters. The author flesh out the 3 main characters which are Eren, Mikasa and Armin. The secondary characters are not shown too often so obviously the readers won't be too interested in them. And I'm not talking about redshirts characters I'm talking about the characters that we will get to grow with during the series. IMO. Armin and jean got the most development in the first 30 chapters, although they are both my least favorite characters. Now around chapter 35 is when the author starts to give focus on the secondary characters. And start to flesh them out more as in making us know their motives and also how they fit in the story\/plot overall. There is a few more characters that needs some fleshing out\/character development. But overall Isayama is doing a solid job with his character especially in a story driven series. About the female characters, I like how he balance it out as in making both the male and female cast both having important roles in the story.\n\n\nEnjoyment: 10\/10.  This series is very enjoyable. Not only it has a great story but also it has plenty of action in it that gives me goosebumps. I also like how strategic the fights are in attack on titan especially when it comes to titan vs titan fight. There is no get angry enough and you will win type of fights. Female titan vs eren is a good eg. And I'm not talking about the anime filler with fire titan eren. Or power of friendship defeat the bad guys. If you don't stay calm and think logically you are going to lose. Finding weaknesses and exploiting them is what attack on titan fights are about. Eren vs armored titan is another good eg to that. overall I enjoy the living hell out of this series. The conspiracy, the mystery, the action\/horror it all makes this series a series to remember.\n\nOverall: 10\/10.  As I said before, if you want full enjoyment for this series. Re read it. If you are caught up and you're lost on the plot or you just feel you're forgetting things. Just reread it, pay attention and analyze everything. When you reread this series you will notice a lot of things you didn't notice the first time. Its also funny when you're rereading the manga and you know all the traitors in the series. You will also see how suspicious they were. Anyways time to wrap things up. Don't breeze through the chapters when reading it, take your time and enjoy the series for what it's. Whoever that has made it this far, thnx for reading! And I hope you have a wonderful day.","chapters_read":67,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":0,"art":0,"character":0,"enjoyment":0},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/keragamming","username":"keragamming","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/3213795.jpg?t=1645069800"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/3213795.webp?t=1645069800"}}}},{"mal_id":390298,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=390298","type":"manga","votes":183,"date":"2021-04-07T12:02:00+00:00","review":"Want to learn on how to make an amazing main character, an amazing manga and just absolutely shit on it all right at the end?

I'm an older anime fan, so I remember just how huge Attack on Titan was when it first came out. Especially the anime back in 2013. I'm going to be perfectly honest...I've never liked Attack on Titan. It's not like I thought it was cool as a kid and now I'm embarrassed because I'm trying to put on airs and I see this series as a reminder of my less culturally refined past. I'm dead serious, I have NEVER liked this franchise. I've basically been hate reading this manga onand off for the last 8 years.\n\nLet's start at the beginning. We have a dystopian world where our heroes are constantly besieged by stupid, drooling giants. It's standard zombie apocalypse tropes but with brainless giants. Also the heroes need to fight the giants using zip lines and swords. That part was actually pretty creative, it looked cool, and it's what made Attack on Titan instantly stand out. Eren is the edgy, rage fueled protagonist who lives simply to exterminate every last giant. He's not a particularly nice person or developed character in the beginning. He's basically the \"Goblin Slayer\" only he's the Giant Slayer. Then you have Armin Arlert, whose name is a really cringeworthy pun on \"armed and alert\". Although Armin is a real German name. He's the quiet, nice guy who is the straight man in this crazy world. You have Mikasa, who is the quiet, beautiful, and badass chick. Then you have Levi and his character in the first arc is that he's cool. He's like Legolas from Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy as a manga character. He also has this adorable little cleaning quirk because it's manga. The art in the early manga is BAD, but it doesn't really matter. The Walking Dead was HUGE in 2010. This is like the Walking Dead only flying on ziplines to kill giants! How could any teenager avoid loving this?! I was 25 when I first started the manga and I was a little more jaded. It just never really clicked with me.\n\nNow we get to part 2 and this is where the manga hits its stride. We learn there is some kind of secret going on with the government of Paradis. We learn that Titans used to be human, but we aren't sure who the first Titan was or how it happened. What's up with the Beast Titan?! What's in that basement!? This was 2013-2015 when the series was at its zenith of popularity and social media was exploding in size. Video essays on Youtube are becoming huge and fan speculation on Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, Youtube, and everywhere else is off the charts. EVERYONE is talking about Attack on Titan. EVERYONE has their own theories and their own head canon. Even as someone who didn't like the series, I was still excited. This was Game of Thrones for Weebs! \n\nNow we reach part 3 in which the series tries to be more political and things get messy. So there is an ethnic group called the Eldians, who all have names like Schmidt and M\u00fcller and Schr\u00f6der. Years ago, they used magic and super science to create an army of stupid giants and try genocide the rest of the planet to create Lebensraum for their master race. I thought at first that the Eldians were supposed to literally be ethnic Germans and this was some Wolfenstein future, but Isayama didn't go quite that far. They're clearly Germans, but we don't call them that. Eventually though, the allies turned the tide on the Eldian war machine and transformed the once proud, giant Wehrmacht against their own. The Eldian leader felt such guilt over his people's crimes that he walled them all in on the island of Madagascar and wiped their memories. The rest of the world still hates them and wishes to exterminate them as revenge, but the King has basically resigned his people to eventual genocide out of \"Eldian Guilt\". The whole reason for choosing Madagascar is a reference to the \"Madagascar Plan\" in which the Nazis would ship Jews to Madagascar rather than killing them. The series actually switches between portraying the Eldians as Jews and Germans because the symbolism is careless and Isayama flat out admits he just likes adding historical \"easter eggs\" because it's cool. Japanese liberals along with Korean and Chinese online communities actually attacked Isayama for Japanese nationalism and felt that he was saying Japanese are the Eldians and the Japanese government is cucked and dooming the Japanese people to Chinese domination out of WW2 guilt. However, Isayama never actually meant to say anything. It's all just careless, edgy bullshit and it comes CRASHING down in part 4.\n\nWe get a bullshit time jump, which is always a good start. Eren has become shonen Hitler and is obsessed with Operation Let's Get Ready to Rumble! He's going to use an army of retarded giants to literally step on every non volksdeutsche on the planet! Isayama is SO smug at this point. He's literally thinking \"Haha! I tricked you kids into rooting for shonen Hitler! I got you!\" He seems completely oblivious to the fact that at least half the fans are unironically rooting for Eren either out of sheer edgyness, because it's hilarious,  or because this series unfortunately has a far right problem. It's a bit of all 3. Any subtlety or nuance is just gone now. It now wants to teach this simplistic, shonen moral of hate begets more hate and Eren is the clear cut villain. He dies, but only after killing the majority of the planet and leaving Eldians as the majority ethnicity on Earth. However, no lesson was actually learned by the common people. The war is still ongoing at the end of the manga, so either the surviving Eldians are going to finish the job or the tide turns and the Eldians are finished. There is no possible good ending, but I'll try write an acceptable ending myself. The Eldians and non-Eldians hold a temporary truce and sign a non-aggression pact. As a result of scientific breakthroughs, Humanity flees Earth to escape the planet now devastated by the Rumbling. After a brief Golden Age, an Eldian tyrant named Rudolph von Goldenbaum who is a distant relative of Eren, ushers in a new dark age of mass murder and oppression. The surviving non-Eldians band together with some conscientious Eldians to form the Free Planet Alliance, directly leading to a better series.\n\nAfter 8 years of reading this edgy, stupid, bullshit I can finally close this chapter of my life. The series actually has some good elements. It's not a terrible series all around. However, the sheer level of acclaim that it got both confuses and infuriates me. There are plenty of flawed, trashy, silly series that I like. I'm certainly not saying I'm somehow casting judgement on Attack on Titan fans. However, Attack on Titan was able to get away Scott free with being juvenile, poorly written, edgy garbage for a decade and only now is it just beginning to get called out on it! If you're an SAO fan, you get made fun of so hard that you probably don't want to discuss anime online. You're the untouchable of the anime community, all because a couple Anitubers turned one of the most popular light novels of all time into this essential punching bag. If you're a Gundam fan, you have to always be on your backfoot if you're away from your safe space on 4chan \/m\/. Everyone else you fear might think you're an autistic weirdo who has a fetish for giant robots and you have to explain, \"well actually, there are very complex and well realized themes in Gundam. You see, the Earth Federation was meant by Tomino to symbolize...\" If you're an Elfen Lied fan like me, you will face a pretty frequent stream of random strangers who want to dunk on you. You're on your backfoot so often that you begin to deeply question the acceptability of your own taste. You have to seriously practice your online debate skills just so everyone won't think you're a slack jawed, uncultured moron with an IQ of 80. That's the immediate assumption that people online will have. The fact Attack on Titan fans have gotten a free ride loving this stupid garbage for so long is just indescribably frustrating.

This review is based on the manga till the end of volume 3. Shingeki no Kyojin is a unique manga, in that it is bears more of a resemblance to Western fiction than to Japanese fiction. In some ways, it is similar to Gantz, but overall it borrows heavily from western steampunk and fantasy novels. STORY: 9\/10 Even though I'm only 3 volumes in, it is apparent that the story has immense potential. The immense world around the small area in which the story is set is shrouded in mystery. Absolutely nothing can be guessed about it at this point. In the future, themanga will most probably involve revelations and discoveries about this world.\nIncidents in the protagonists' past are being gradually revealed. The main character seems to have some form of memory loss. While this may seem clich\u00e9, so far it has being handled well.\nThe author appears to have an extensive understanding of the world he has created, in the vein of JRR Tolkien's Middle Earth.\nIn addition, the steampunk technology used is fairly believable, and even explained at the end of chapters.\nI must confess the revelation of the main character's power took me completely by surprise. This leads me to believe that the author will handle plot twists very well.\n\nART: 7.5\/10\nThe art, while not bad by any means, has a tendency to be slightly rough. It is completely hand drawn. The illustrations of the giants are quite impressive, and character design is unique. Backgrounds are some times less detailed, while distant shots of characters tend to be \"derpy\".

Is it money, love, property, or something else? Well, everyone has his or her own ideas but for there's one thing we all have in common and that's the fact that we are all living beings that breathes in and out. We live by and enjoy life as best as we can. But what if that right is certainly put into jeopardy? What if a day comes when the place we live in no longer remains safe? Well, those are probably questions not many of us think about too often but for Mankind in this manga, thosequestions are people's heads every single day of their lives.\n\nUnfortunately, one day, some of those questions finally came with answers..in the worst way possible.\n\nShingeki no Kyojin (or by its more commonly known English title \"Attack on Titan\") is a Japanese manga written by Hajime Isayama. The series takes place in an alternative setting of the middle ages, a dark times when mankind is threatened by the appearances of giants. The human population is in jeopardy and often times, fear fuels both hatred and determination to live and eradicates the titans that threatens their very lives every day.\n\nWell for starters, I am pleased to say that Shingeki no Kyojin is a great manga to have in almost anyone's collection. I am not very familiar with the author. However, what I am familiar with is the way he presents his piece of work. By the name of the title \"Attack on Titan\", one may assume that the manga is related to a fantasy\/adventure type genre series. Of course, you would be right if that was your assumption. However, this series marks more of a dark fantasy tale of horror and tragedy as from the very first chapters, we learn of the consequences Mankind starts dealing with. \n\nThe main character of the story is a young boy named Eren. Throughout his childhood, he has lived with his foster sister Mikasa Ackerman, his best friend Armin Arlart, and his mother. On the surface, readers may find his character to be impulsive, violent, and often or not acts without thinking. In other words, he is the type of guy that resorts to action rather than strategy. Unfortunately for him and his family, violence and action comes no less than from the giants. We are quickly introduced to a colossal titan from the very beginning as it makes history that levers the walls which stood between Mankind and the giants. Although not seemingly realistic, we can can imagine the people going through as the giants makes their way through and shattering the peace that Mankind has built for nearly a century. It is staggering and more so after these tragic events that would  change Eren and his life forever.\n\nLuckily, Eren seemingly follows a path of valor and plays the role of a protagonist rather than as a vengeful anti-hero. Although he displays his thoughts of vengeance at many times, Eren keeps his mind in check that what he's doing is for sake of Mankind and its existence. Speaking of which, Mikasa also plays her roles well. For a female character, she is very intelligent, resourceful, and independent enough to land some kills against the giants themselves. We can see easily that Mikasa plays the anti-thesis of the gender role from the middle ages as she displays superhuman like behavior throughout the manga. \n\nThe other characters throughout the manga also gets their own development, spotlights, and in more mysterious ways; some that holds secrets where we may never have imagined them to be. Among these secrets involves the giants and Eren's identity. Speaking of which, at many occasions, the manga explores the theme of identity and what people sees themselves as. For example, Armin Arlart is often confused about his place as a member of the military. He often seems to blame himself as being useless despite his ability to help out others at crucial times that have saved the lives of his dear friends. Mankind itself also begins to mount resistance and making its race a name for the giants to fear. Every drop of blood is a loss for humanity and with population staggering, everyone tries to contribute their efforts against their ultimate enemy \u2013 the Giants.\n\nWell, that of course brings us to the very horror that started it all. The Giants.\n\nThe manga captures the horror of what Giants truly are. On the surface, they have humanoid-like  structure such as their facial features and similarly shaped body resemblance with the same amount. However, what they lack is empathy and seemingly exist for the purposes to kill. Rather than feeding, these Giants are the true adversaries and destroyers of Mankind. However at the same time, the series inspires mystery as to their origins and how they came to exist in such a world. Nevertheless, their behavior spells out more words than action as they live to devour humans and make Mankind a living nightmare. Among other factors, the titans are classified differently for variant types. There are the normal titans, armored titan, muscular titan, ape-like titan, hairy titan, and of course the Colossal titan that started the conflict all over again. They are true horrors and the executioners of Mankind.\n\nThe manga series adapts the medieval-like feeling well. At many times, we can see that Mankind really did put effort into creating the peace they desired. The outer later of Wall Maria stands tall and proud as it has outlasted over a century. Among other factors are the inner walls, cannons, and guns. Most curiously though is the usage of a device known as the Three Dimensional Maneuver Gear. The device functions as both a tool and weapon used against the giants for those who have enough skills. Those who truly wishes to protect Mankind and challenge against the giants enlists in the military for crude training against what they both fear and hate. \n\nAmong other things, there seems to be some symbolism throughout the manga. The walls stands for both a physical feature but also seems to symbolize the way Mankind seems to isolate themselves as an united race. Mankind knows that without cooperation, death will likely resurface and blood will be spilled. Then, there's the idea of survival of the fittest. If we look carefully, those who have the skills, intellect, and determination will have the potential to make it through. Those that are weak, reliant, and doubting themselves are the first to die. It is a cruel world and the giants themselves makes that world into reality.\n\nWhile the realism of the the series is a bit weak, I do find that horrors portrayed in this manga is well executed. The giants seems to lack motive to killing people but when they do, it always ends brutal that leaves behind both physical and mental scars. Some of these may never be healed. In more than one way, the giants plays the role of the super power as they strives to dominate against humanity. More curiously enough, not all of them are as mindless as we may think. But nonetheless, the giants are the horrors that mankind must deal with. The gore and violence presented gives readers a visually sense of just how serious the situation is. It's a cruel, cruel world out there.\n\nThere are many questions that needs answers still with this manga. However, by the way of Mankind's expressions, they are not very patient. This manga published by Kodansha is ultimately a piece of work that I enjoyed reading so far. There are some distractions occasionally with the gore and may frustrate readers with the mystery aspect of the work, especially in regards to Mankind's ultimate enemy. However, it has collected enough interests with the origins of its presentation, delivery, artwork, and for me is an enjoyable read. It's a horrific tale that questions how fragile lives can be in a world that rains of blood, terror, and destruction.\n\n[Note: This is my first manga review.

Take a step back. Think about something for a moment... what is a story meant to do? There are several answers. One: a story is meant to entertain. People tell stories to pass the time, or bring out emotions we feel in our daily lives that we either want to feel again, or would rather hide. In doing this, we\u2019re amused, excited, terrified, or saddened. Maybe it\u2019s all of them at once. Two: stories are meant to teach, inform, or complicate ideas in a way we\u2019ve not thought of before. Theyrecontextualize the events of the world and its people through the lens of setting, narrative, characters, and themes.  \n\nWith this in mind, we see now that there are many different types of stories. There are straightforward stories that go from point A to point B, stories that are really only meant to pass the time, and thoughtful, introspective stories with layers upon layers of hidden meaning. \n\nSo what is Attack on Titan? \n\nAttack on Titan is the kind of story that doesn\u2019t just move from point A to point B. Attack on Titan moves from point A to point C\u2014and in going back to show B, develops A and C\u2019s themes, meaning, and context to a degree many stories can never achieve. \n\nAttack on Titan is the kind of story that isn\u2019t just meant to pass the time; but if you allow yourself to get invested in its mysteries, setting, and characters, then you\u2019ll find time flies by with each chapter as you watch the conflict embroil itself in a mixture of action and nuance many stories can never properly balance. \n\nAttack on Titan is the kind of story that doesn\u2019t just have layers\u2014its layers are all intimately connected. Philosophies from people and places that tie into history from similar places and time periods absolutely pervade Attack on Titan\u2019s underbelly\u2014glued in place by the strong threads of Norse Mythology, meaningful conclusions, and compelling human drama. It\u2019s tied together with a lovely bow; a question that ultimately describes the entirety of the work itself\u2026 \u201cWhat is the cost of freedom?\u201d Or maybe now that question is, \u201cIs freedom obtainable at all?\u201d \n\nMore than anything, Attack on Titan proves that what something needs is TIME. Time to develop, time to prove that what it brings to the table isn\u2019t stale, generic, or overdone. To this day, I have a hard time imagining something that could succeed any further. Maybe the story was generic when it began, or at least looked it\u2014but it\u2019s not anymore. The art in the early chapters was certainly rough, but it evolved into a gorgeous style that depicted some of the most beautiful and unsettling images I\u2019ve seen over the course of a visual medium like manga. \n\nThis, however, needs to be said; the ending was a perfect conclusion to all of the story\u2019s themes and values. To elaborate further I must go into spoilers. SO! If you don\u2019t want to know what happens and why I think it is good for the narrative, then STOP READING at the end of this paragraph, and go read the manga for yourself. \n\n!!----SPOILERS----!!\n\nDo we only have disillusioned readers and\/or readers happy with the ending? Are the only readers left ones that have finished the story? Yes? Okay, good. \n\nFor the past few hours after finishing Attack on Titan, I browsed the community in various forums, comment sections, and subreddits. What I saw there was an overwhelming, titanic wave of discontent and toxic vitriol at the choices made in the concluding arc and final chapter of the story. I cannot say that this surprises me. Many fan communities have analyzed Attack on Titan to such a degree, and for such a long time, that many misunderstood plot developments and truly disturbing amounts of self-projection ran absolutely rampant in any discussion about the manga as the final thirty-plus chapters released month after month, thus transforming into WILDLY off-base expectations. I was a fool for holding out hope that the readers would see what exactly this final chapter has done for the story, and I am probably a fool to even be writing this defense; but I have to put my perspective out there for the fans that agree and need something to point to. I don\u2019t want this to become a bullet-point essay, but I think that might be the only way to handle each topic; so I will address the most common criticisms with the chapter and final arc one by one. \n\nThroughout the entire story, we are shown time and time again that Eren has been a slave to circumstance. As Isayama has said himself, \u201cThe story drove Eren.\u201d However, after the timeskip, we see instead that \u201cEren is driving the story.\u201d In more ways than one, this is pretty much the exact same thing, further cemented by the fact that the final chapter confirms Eren\u2019s influence on the citing incident of his rage; Dina\u2019s pure titan eating his mother. Because Eren\u2019s connection to the Founder in the paths has made him an omnipresent-but-not-omniscient being whose interaction with his memories are neither clear nor obvious, all he could do was work toward the freedom he saw for his friends at the end of such memories (and thus, logically, the end of his life). Deviating from this path even once could result in him not getting this outcome, and such; he was a slave from the beginning. A slave to his idea of freedom, and a slave to the destiny he never wanted, but couldn\u2019t run away from. \n\nWhile this revelation is intrinsically about the character of Eren, what I think Isayama also wanted to do is critique of the concept of \u201cfreedom\u201d itself. The things we do in name of it, and what we think it is. I\u2019m no scientist, but there\u2019s a study about our decisions and \u201cfree will\u201d that\u2019s a bit alarming. In short, it states that our brain fires off and moves forward with actions before we consciously think about them. In essence, it\u2019s entirely possible we have no free will. We don\u2019t choose our thoughts, after all, they just come to us, and everything we do may be predestined from the outset. Is this because we\u2019re just animals with electricity in our brains? Is this because something like fate, destiny, or God decided what we\u2019d do with our lives? Or do we have as much free will as everyone else, and fate is something we can\u2019t understand? Regardless, we\u2019re creatures trapped by habit, circumstances, environment, and even history. The idea of true \u201cfreedom\u201d is not applicable to this singular truth. All we have is the choices we make and why we made them, and that is the exact position in which Eren\u2019s whole story is framed. Will Armin be capable of saving humanity from the \u201cdevil\u201d of Eren Jaeger if not for becoming the Colossal Titan? Would Eren be so driven by hatred if not for the death of his mother? Without that setup, who\u2019s to know if there can be the same outcome? If the freedom and lives of Armin and Mikasa are the desired effect, and the end of your memories reflect that, then there\u2019s truly only one thing to do. In that sense, Eren traps himself in his own cycle of violence by catalyzing it in the first place. The same cycle of violence reflected in the story\u2019s themes of prejudice and conflict. It\u2019s truly poetic. \n\nWe also see Eren finally express how he truly feels to Armin in the first half of this chapter, shattering a misplaced assumption about his character that many fans had. He was never a coldhearted, evil bastard out to destroy the world and hurt his friends. Didn\u2019t we see that when he broke down and apologized to Ramzi? All of it was a fa\u00e7ade, an attempt to create the outcome he foresaw. Once again; forever trapped, a slave to the freedom of those he cared for most. \n\nIn parallel to this, Ymir herself was not just a slave, but a slave that came to love her master. This is known as \u201cStockholm Syndrome\u201d and is a very real thing. That even after all this horrible treatment, the promise of love is a driving force that keeps people chained down in abusive relationships. No matter how it\u2019s gone about, Eren\u2019s decisions, even if for the benefit of Mikasa and the others, cannot be anything but manipulative and abusive. There\u2019s a reason Ymir was watching with a smile when Mikasa found the power to sever this connection\u2014both were finally free of their captivity. While this is certainly one more reason to see Eren\u2019s choices as reprehensible, it preserves his motivations and integrity. \n\nSo why the rumbling, if not to follow through? \n\nI think the rumbling failing to end war is the only logical conclusion to arrive at. It\u2019s fair to want Eren\u2019s sacrifice to be everlasting, but think of it this way; it was still effective. No matter how you spin it, humanity has always and WILL always solve their problems with violence. Taking away titanization doesn\u2019t leave Paradis defenseless, because 80% of the world was leveled, rendering what I can only assume is nearly ALL of the world\u2019s nations powerless. This gives Paradis adequate room to establish itself as the powerhouse of the planet, or at the very least, puts it on equal footing with where everyone else was beforehand. In framing the alliance as heroes and Eren as the devil, while removing the trait of Eldians that the world hated them for in the first place, the rumbling has successfully bought time for our characters to live. Obviously this is not a cure-all. At some point, people will come for Paradis. However, it will be in the future, after Mikasa, Armin, Jean, Connie, and Levi\u2026 you know, the people EREN SPECIFICALLY CARES ABOUT\u2026 have lived long, happy lives. Please also understand; the world beginning anew at the end of the \u201cbattle of heaven and earth\u201d with the dead returning to fight alongside the gods are not poor writing, but references to Norse Mythology that have run parallel to the entire story. \n\nThe \u201cfinal panel\u201d Isayama showed us all those years ago wasn\u2019t the final panel we got, but we did get it in the form of a single one of Eren\u2019s memories. That baby was him, and the man holding him was Grisha. The father of Historia\u2019s baby was never the red herring, it was her baby itself. It was no baby to inherit the Beast Titan to reactivate the rumbling. Does that align with Eren\u2019s wish for his friends to live long, happy lives? No\u2014it just perpetuates the curse of the titans and makes the baby a slave too. Instead, the importance of this baby is not who fathered her, but the fact that she can now live in a world free of titans, free of walls, and free of threat in the span of her life. \n\nI don\u2019t know what more you could ask for. Isayama said he wanted to hurt us, and he did. How? Because\u2014Eren, in the end, was finally able to be honest. He loved Mikasa, and he loved Armin. He didn\u2019t want to die, and he certainly didn\u2019t want to kill so many innocent people; but wasn\u2019t willing to gamble on changing the outcome he knew would be worth it. In fact, he truly believed he couldn\u2019t. From top to bottom, the story is a tragedy about a boy who kept moving forward in his quest for freedom, even when he discovered he would never obtain it for himself. \n\nThere is no character assassination. There are no dropped plot threads. And while there are plot holes if you look deep enough, I\u2019d like to remind you that there is no story without such problems. What was obtained here was an incredible feat of storytelling that I think will stand on its own as a truly monumental manga from start to finish. \n\nIf you take issue with it, that is completely, one hundred percent okay. What ISN\u2019T okay, is harassing Isayama, WIT, MAPPA, Kodansha, Bessatsu Shonen Magazine, the voice actors, Isayama\u2019s editor, or anyone else affiliated with the story, NOR is it okay to harass fans who liked the ending or disagree with your opinion; and it is ESPECIALLY not okay to spoil them. Recognize that you have nothing to blame but your own expectations for your disappointment, and accept it.","chapters_read":139,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":10,"art":8,"character":10,"enjoyment":10},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/KeyMovingForward","username":"KeyMovingForward","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/4402111.jpg?t=1645062000"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/4402111.webp?t=1645062000"}}}},{"mal_id":390675,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=390675","type":"manga","votes":101,"date":"2021-04-08T09:14:00+00:00","review":"***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*** Wtf, after 12 Years the AOT manga has endend and the ending had a big impact on the fanbase itself. But even this time the fans don't even defend Isayama anymore then you know how much he f--ked up. The worst part is that he made jokes like \"If I am done, I will open a spa of the tears and sweat of my readers\". Yeah any fan would cry from the inside if the person they are looking up to says \"Fuck You\". Its just what Disney did to Starwars, the triology came to an ending but nope we need sequelsthat are as bad but not worst then these last terrible chapters.\n\nIn conclusion AOT was once considerd a mordern masterpiece that fell from his grace when Isayama hired a few people to write the last chapters of the Manga, so bad was it written. I can now say that Isayama is a bad writer. I would like to know in a different universe how AOT would have turned out, where it were only titans and no titan-shifters\/paths\/politics and that the story was just about mindless titans. Yeah it would have been less intressting but that could have ended way better then this shitty ending. Because I always liked the charm of Aot from season 1. If they kept that then it would take a different route but a way better one in my opinion.\n\nChapter 1 to 123 are mostly really well written but I dont know what he was smoking when making chap 124 to 139. I was never a fan of this arc but this arc shows wich characters have plot-Armour, destroying the main trio characters arcs(except Armin) and with a terrible happy ending that could\u00a0 have been done way better but he cracked the code to make the worst ending. The motivation of Eren is now just a joke and he couldnt kill characters because he was scared of his fanbase. Verry funny because everyone was always like, oh boy these characters wont survive for long. \"Thats a lie\", and how did the romance go now that I am thinking hmmm..... Idk. Oh yeah (spoiler alert) Eren turns into a bird, symbolism 100. Hahahahaha......thanks Mappa for adapting the best part, how they would react to making the ending.....This is sad, worst 1 April joke ever Issyami.\n\nThis is all, what a terrible rollercoaster, it still wasnt finnished yet.....I rather consider AOT doujins canon then this ending, f--king hell. I need to see \"How To Train Your Dragon 3\" again to know what an amazing ending is. \n\nThe only good part about the ending was the art. I hope the anime goes Original so that anime fans dont suffer the same way but I fear the worst. Spoiling AOT now isnt that big of a crime anymore.

Well, the short answer is yes. The long answer is yes, but I do really enjoy vore, which earns it points. God, I wish I lived in the Attack on Titan universe. I would join the survey corps 100%. I\u2019d keep straying from the formation a bit just hoping some hulking female titan would take a hunk out of me. Speaking of female titans, isn\u2019t it weird that of the original 9 titans there\u2019s shit like the beast titan, thewarhammer titan, the armored titan, or the colossal titan, and then there\u2019s the \u201cfemale\u201d titan. This is explained by the fact that the female titan has no unique abilities, and instead mimics the abilities of the other titans, but what would happen if a male ate the female titan? Does it turn you female? Armin probably wishes he could eat the female titan. I digress.\n\nLet\u2019s start with what Attack on Titan does well. Okay, so next I want to talk about the art. It\u2019s quite bad in the beginning, but it eventually becomes serviceable. It is never good. Isayama often neglects to draw backgrounds, even during pivotal conversations, and I sometimes found it difficult to distinguish characters. Despite this, it manages to have pretty fluid and good-looking combat scenes for the most part. And isn\u2019t that what Attack on Titan is all about? Fighting titans, turning into titans, eating titans. Well, not exactly.\n\nAttack on Titan is like a hot girl with an annoying voice. Well, maybe not hot, but you know, you\u2019re a lonely guy, you\u2019ll take what you can get and all. In any case, there was altogether too much talking in this manga. The arcs that centered around politics were dull and nonsensical, at least until the end, when the political plotline still makes no sense but is pretty undeniably entertaining. (It doesn\u2019t help that one of the major plot twists of the Royal Government arc is practically recycled in the Marley arc.) The climactic battles were enjoyable enough, although when the mangaka thinks \u201cwe can\u2019t win if we don\u2019t fight\u201d is a line worth repeating a dozen times it does lesson my emotional investment a bit.\n\nOne of the ways Attack on Titan garnered attention early on was by catching its readers off guard. And there are quite a few unexpected events, some more logical than others. At some point, though, it begins to feel like the entire plot is structured around these \u201cbig reveals,\u201d and the intention is that the readers will clap every time their expectations are subverted. However, this stops working when the reveals start to feel more like asspulls and the universe\u2019s internal logic increasingly falls apart. At one point, a guy gets wings, and no one is really sure why. Then another guy may or may not turn into a bird. It\u2019s all a lot to process.\n\nArmin is annoying. I can say that right? I dislike him quite a lot. Hate him, really. At one point a character lists off a number of clever ideas that Armin has had, in an effort to prove his indispensable value. I was left in disbelief, because while it is true that Armin does 100% of the thinking in the manga and comes up with 100% of the solutions, I attributed this to laziness or carelessness; I never expected it to actually be acknowledged. Eren may be the \u201che\u2019s just like me\u201d guy everyone uses as an profile pic, but Armin is the one who feels like a self-insert.\n\nI will say that Eren\u2019s character development, if forced, was pretty fun. He starts off as a completely typical shounen protagonist, but is eventually mindbroken into becoming the guy from Taxi Driver. Did this make sense? Not entirely. Did I expect it to at that point? Not even a little. Zeke would have been a better protagonist, really, but if anything the series would have benefitted from more of Eren and less of Mikasa and Armin. Mikasa isn\u2019t as bad as Armin, who I loathe, but she is pretty one dimensional. Even Levi (who I am convinced is only so popular because he makes short men feel better about themselves) is more interesting. By the way, why do Mikasa and Levi never talk about both being Ackermans? It\u2019s discussed that this makes them both strong, fast, and cool, but wouldn\u2019t there be at least one moment where they went \u201coh wait, we\u2019re relatives?\u201d\n\nHonestly, Attack on Titan is at its best when it reads like Eren\u2019s power fantasy.

What an incredible story. Isayama made a very bold decision ending it in what seems to be the middle of an arc but 131 was one of the best chapters I've ever read so its excusable. Eren is one of the greatest characters in alI of anime and manga and I'm sure if the story continued he wouldnt become a walking contradiction reduced to a simp, going against his ideals established since the very first chapter, being stripped of everything that made him a phenomenal and complex character! Great story so glad I spent 8 years of my life reading this monthly. Edit: Admittedly theearlier review was a kneejerk reaction to bad translations but I still hate the ending and the direction eren's character took.\n\nHe was previously characterized as someone with absurd resolve who, despite being mentally anguished by what hes doing, fought for the freedom of himself and the people he loved against the destiny laid out for them being born as eldians, but then he obtains the founder and he just becomes a complete bitch to fate? for what the sake of irony? Mentally falling apart after gaining near omnipotence isnt OOC for eren, anyone knowing the past present and future would break down because theres nothing you can do just accept the future laid out for you and I hate that it happened to eren because he was characterized so well before and all of that just broke down immediately and took away everything that made his character special because pretty much anyone would have the same reaction. The worst thing is that it happened off screen at least show us eren experiencing this, show us eren trying to change the immediate future only for it to be futile and his reaction to that, this idea of determinism is not something you formally introduce and resolve in one chapter.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of determinism is just shit and excuses bad writing. \"Why did eren let the alliance kill him despite his previous unbreaking conviction to rumble the world?\" Valid question but the answer Isayama expects you to accept is that its because \"it was alway's gonna be this way no one ever had a choice in anything.\", because this lelouch bullshit definitely doesn't achieve his \"primary goal\" of allowing his friends to live long lives as Paradis is about to go to war with the 350 million people left alive with their measly population of 1 mil. I put primary goal in quotes as he had other goals he valued equally except he just forgot about them which leads to my next point. \n\nThere are also OOC moments for eren, notably his seemingly flimsy desire for the rumbling. Say what you want about his \"head being messed up\", but he previously had clear convictions as to why hes doing the rumbling and the buildup to those revelations climaxing with his apology to ramzi and the freedom panel was incredible but now he forgot and it means nothing apparently. EM was also not built up well at all and the \"I dont want her to find another man\" scene was utter cringe regardless of ships. \n\nThe worst part of Eren and Armin's final conversation is that it should have been the climax of their  \"ideological battle\" (I put this in quotes because there hasn't really been a battle just armin wank for the past 5 chapters). Part of what made 121-123 so phenomenal is the ideological battle between Eren and Zeke. They had 2 rational ideologies(from their respective perspectives) that were founded and built up incredibly well and we're actually shown why erens ideology won. To put it simply: despite all the bullshit they go through humans have an innate desire to want to live and fight to be free. This is reflected in Ymir and we understand why she chose eren's ideology and it works phenomenally on every front; it lines up with and enhances the previously established story, themes, and characters. Now compare it to the Eren Armin conflict, Armin's ideology won because ???. I don't fucking know, the best explanation is \"Eren bad Armin good\".\n\nNext I want to talk about how terribly Eren's time on screen was managed in the chapter which will also build on the previous point. Eren has 20 pages in the chapter where he's speaking. Of those 20, 8 are spent explaining his dogshit plan to armin and how ymir loves fritz, 3 are spent on the useless shock value eren accidentally killed his mom plot twist, 5 are about mikasa and how sad he is that jean's gonna hit that gorilla grip coochie, 2 are his goodbye to armin, and only fucking 2 pages are about his ideology and motives. Compare that to 131: the audience is in the dark surrounding eren's inner thoughts from 95-123 and 131 masterfully displays his ideology, motives, and everything in between, dedicating almost the entire chapter to solely eren. Similarly, by 139 the audience has been in the dark about eren's inner thoughts from 123-138, except this time less than half the chapter is dedicated to eren and even then, most of the time spent on eren is useless garbage that doesn't get to the meat and potatoes of his character like 131 does.\n\nThe irony of Eren never being able to achieve freedom after the irredeemable acts hes done is good but not like this, him dying to put an end to the curse to allow Armin to live for a long time + not burden any future children w 13 year lifespan, after securing paradis' safety would have been much better for example, and would also line up with him being a dick to Armin and Mikasa to distance them.\n\nFinally, the symbolism of Eren and the bird at the end implying he's free is downright insulting. For 138 chapters death has always equalled the loss of freedom especially so for Eren who fought so hard to stay alive, so suddenly implying that he's found freedom in accepting his circumstances and dying is garbage.\n\nAlso these are only my problems regarding erens character, there's so much more regarding Ymir being in love with king shitz + forced Mikasa Ymir parallels, Reiner's unsatisfying conclusion, \"thank you for becoming a mass murderer for our sake\" LMAO, seemingly forgotten themes (surpassing the father, keeping children out of the forest, ending the cycle of hatred, etc), and much more I could write a goddamn essay on why the ending sucked ass.\n\nI'll still rate it as a 10 and pretend it ended at 131 because this series means a lot to me and I grew up with it so I'm coping super hard lol.","chapters_read":131,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":0,"art":0,"character":0,"enjoyment":0},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/SeanN30","username":"SeanN30","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/questionmark_50.gif"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/questionmark_50.gif"}}}},{"mal_id":99677,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=99677","type":"manga","votes":200,"date":"2013-06-03T14:38:00+00:00","review":"This review is up to chapter 45. First of all, if you haven't read Shingeki no Kyojin yet, go do it. I'm not usually this enthusiastic about shounen manga, but SNK has managed to become the exception, simply because it's so damn good. Why? What makes it better than other works in similar genres? Well, my little ones, SNK is so well thought out. Meticulously so. From the plot to the characters, everything has just that extra layer that pushes SNK to become an outstanding piece of writing. There are plot twists often, and boy, can they catch you off guard. Allof the characters contribute to the development of the story and each other. I'm picky when meeting characters, and even though this manga has about 1,000,000 of them, it is easy to differentiate and love even the most minor. This is definitely a story that I would buy and read over and over until the pages are worn.\n\nAnd, well, as for the art.... There are some 'inconsistencies' that kind of annoy me - mainly that they way jaws are drawn from profile makes their faces look like tomato cans - but aside from minor things, it is a refreshing style. Isayama's art doesn't have \"copy\/paste face\" - meaning that the only thing that physically changes from character to character is the eye size -- rather each character has their own specific features. It doesn't sound like that much to ask for, but this is regrettably rare for anime\/manga. It's actually quite daring, and I can appreciate a good oasis in the desert of generalized faces. \n\nOverall, this is the kind of manga that makes you think. I've been reading for a long time, but never have I spent so much time going over possibilities and predictions in my head. Not only that, but you genuinely care about what's happening. It's the  kind of story that your jaw drops, your eyes widen, and your heart beat wildly with anticipation. And as for the fandom, it has an amazing range of artists, writers, thinkers, and crackifiers, and I enjoy every second of being apart of it.\n\nSimply put, Shingeki no Kyojin is fantastic; a regular 10\/10 would bang. I'd recommend it to anyone, even people who don't read manga. Go. Go read it now. Then friend me so we can talk about it into the wee hours of the morning.","chapters_read":45,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":10,"art":7,"character":10,"enjoyment":10},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/nicetush","username":"nicetush","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/2660533.jpg?t=1372384800"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/2660533.webp?t=1372384800"}}}},{"mal_id":390660,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=390660","type":"manga","votes":70,"date":"2021-04-08T08:57:00+00:00","review":"Attack on Titan is not perfect, nothing is. That being said it truly deserves to be considered a modern classic and will go down as one of the most influential series to come out of this medium. (this review will be spoiler free and very vague for those who have not read it) STORY: 9\/10 The story of Attack on Titan is unique, one of a kind, and undeniably brilliant. It has its clich\u00e9s here and there but the overall thought put into writing such an intricate and compelling story is unbelievably impressive. The concept of the series is simple and nothing all that profound; titansinvade humanity, and humanity fights to survive. However, it is soon discovered that this simple premise was not just a one dimensional action packed roller-coaster that it was originally portrayed to be. It was a well thought out, well calculated, and multilayered masterpiece that would be explored to the likes we could've never imagined. Isayama took this simple concept of titans vs humans and effortlessly molded it into a story of politics, racial discrimination, oppression, and many more powerful themes to create a story for the ages. Attack on Titan is able to bring out so much emotion in the reader whether it be through shocking deaths, unexpected plot twists, passionate speeches, and all around incredible storytelling. There is so much more to talk about yet I feel like my words would never do the articulate and beautiful story of Attack on Titan any justice. \n\nART: 8\/10\n\nThe art in Attack on Titan is great, and fairly underrated in my opinion. Obviously series like Berserk, Vagabond, and Slam Dunk are miles ahead but that doesn't mean AOT is any bad. In fact, some panels in Attack on Titan are surprisingly beautiful especially when it comes to later chapters. I will say the art in the beginning of the series is very mediocre however as the series progresses so does the intricacy of the art. Additionally, the character designs especially of the titans is incredible. Their unique anatomy and uneasy facial expressions make them truly stand out from anything this medium has ever produced. However, the fight scenes are where Attack on Titans art is at its best, and truly is able to immerse the reader in the brilliance of the action. There is so much detail to every aspect of the panels, including movement, expression, highlighting, shading, that all come together to create a brilliant flowing scene. Attack on Titan has some amazing art in it that perfectly fits the tone and atmosphere of the series. Combine this with the unique and realistic character designs and you have the recipe for a beautifully drawn and instantly recognizable series. \n\n\nCHARACTERS: 9\/10 \n\nWhere do I even begin? The characters in Attack on Titan are special, and are able to captivate what a lot of other series fail to do. Each of the characters introduced throughout the series serve a purpose in the narrative which makes it easy for the readers to become attached and drawn to their journey. Love him or hate him Eren Yeager is a fantastic protagonist when it comes to writing and character development. The amount of evolution he gets as a character is a rarity to find in this medium and is truly a sight to behold. In fact, every character in the series has amazing development and all evolve in a way from when they were first introduced. It is truly beautiful to see all these characters grow up together and become more and more unique as time goes on. The characters in Attack on Titan age like fine wine, becoming more intricate and detailed as the narrative increases its complexity. I also find it fascinating how the series doesn\u2019t really have a definitive antagonist, as it could really be anyone depending on your point of view. Yes, there are some obvious choices but this dilemma makes the story that much more interesting to read. Not too many series out there can have a lot of characters in their narrative that contrast brilliantly with each other whilst having unique personality traits to make them stand out. The thought put into developing and constructing the characters in Attack on Titan is marvelous and stands out as one of the best. \n\n\nENJOYMENT: 10\/10\n\nReading this manga and watching the show has been one of the most enjoyable things I\u2019ve ever done in my life. As soon as I was hooked to the series I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes off of the screen and literally shouted on multiple occasions out of pure enjoyment. Attack on Titan isn\u2019t the most thought provoking series out there (which is usually my cup of tea) however if we\u2019re talking from a pure enjoyment stand point, there really isn\u2019t anything that can compete with the sheer brilliance of AoT.\n\n\nOVERALL: 9\/10\n\nAttack on Titan is not by any means a perfect series, however it is a god damn good one. If you haven\u2019t taken the time to watch\/read AoT please do yourself a favour and immerse yourself in this fantastic series. I was originally skeptical of the AoT as I usually despise \u201cnormie\u201d shows and thus assumed it was just another hype piece of trash. However, after seeing Gigguks \u201cAttack on Titan is incredible now\u201d I sat down and easily binged through season 1-3 and fell in love with everything it had to offer. After completing The Final Season I read the entire manga from start to finish and now consider myself a fan of the series. I can\u2019t believe it has now ended after over a decade but I truly believe AoT will go down as a modern classic and be remembered forever. Thank you Hajime Isayama and everyone else involved in bringing us this amazing and surreal piece of fiction that I will never forget.\n\nThis is my first ever review on MAL. I don\u2019t expect anyone to read it but I just wanted to give it a go and see what happens. So if you have taken the time to read my review thank you and I truly appreciate it! \n\nDisclaimer (spoilers): I wrote this before the last few chapters were released where I felt like pacing and delivery fell off. My overall score is now a 7. It's truly disappointing that a masterpiece like Attack on Titan didn't end with the same quality it had been providing for its entire run.","chapters_read":139,"scores":{"overall":9,"story":9,"art":8,"character":9,"enjoyment":10},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Huangi","username":"Huangi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/7663238.jpg?t=1645115400"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/7663238.webp?t=1645115400"}}}},{"mal_id":390351,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/reviews.php?id=390351","type":"manga","votes":68,"date":"2021-04-07T16:15:00+00:00","review":"The Manga felt very strong and consistent but ultimately I dont even feel the need to mention anything that happens past CH 139 because it ultimately feels meaningless considering the ending we got.

Shingeki no Kyojin is one of the manga that caught me by surprise and I definitely love reading this. Story 10\/10 Compared to other manga dealing with the supernatural, giants as the main villain is already a very interesting choice. Maybe because giants, even as portrayed in this manga, dont really have special powers; they are just big, very very hard to kill and not picky at eating people. The great thing about this manga is that everything seems very realistic, apart from the existence of the giants. Thestory is set in a apocalyptic type situation where the last human colony faces giant attack threats constantly. After decades of unsuccessful threats on the giants, the characters in this manga are struggling with fear and hopelessness, they are neither heroic nor optimistic.\n\nArt 8\/10\nI enjoyed the mangaka's style, it's gritty and at times, messy, but it sets the manga apart from the rest. The characters all have different features, so it's easy to identify them. However, the best part would have to be the way the mangaka drew the giants. They are so horrible and evil and ughhh... It makes you absolutely terrified whenever you see a giant in any page. And the deaths of all the people eaten by the giants were well drawn. ugh. And the expressions of fear and desperation in the characters' faces, makes you feel so bad for them.\n\nCharacter 9\/10\nI love that the characters in this manga are portrayed realistically. None of the characters have the illusions of being heroic or optimistic. In fact, each of them are selfish in their own ways. After reading many shounen manga where the villains just wont die, it's hard to believe that the heroes can still remain confident and courageous (bleach's kurosaki, dgray's walker). And in this manga, you can see that the characters are just real people with no special powers or weapons, tired of fighting and seeing deaths around them.\n\nEnjoyment 10\/10\nThis manga caught me right from the start. Maybe I just really like the dark, desperate kind of mood that this manga brings (reminds me of early d.gray-man). The villains, the giants, and evil and crazy and horribly terrifying, The main characters are weak, terrified people just struggling to survive. Amazing read.\n\nOverall 10\/10\nI would recommend this to everyone. It is really amazing.","chapters_read":34,"scores":{"overall":10,"story":10,"art":8,"character":9,"enjoyment":10},"user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/bakahaido","username":"bakahaido","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/492144.jpg?t=1372455000"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/userimages\/492144.webp?t=1372455000"}}}}]}
